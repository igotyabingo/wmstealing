The fire burned over 153,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents and causing widespread devastation to entire towns, including Paradise, the small agricultural town near Yosemite National Park that was virtually wiped out. The tragedy led to a renewed sense of concern for the state's wildfire management and the need for more stringent regulations on the use of fire-prone areas.\n\nAnother notable example of California's wildfires was the Woolsey Fire, which burned from November to December 2018 and devastated the San Fernando Valley and surrounding communities.

It implies the ability to make choices, think critically, and live life on one's own terms. In many societies, freedom is cherished as a fundamental right and is seen as essential for economic growth, social cohesion, and human flourishing.\n\n**Safety**, on the other hand, is often linked to the absence of physical or social harm. It involves protecting individuals and societies from harm, violence, and exploitation. Safety can also be associated with security, stability, and prosperity.\n\nIt's worth noting that both freedom and safety are interconnected and can't be achieved independently of one another. A society with high levels of safety may struggle to provide meaningful freedom, or vice versa.\n\nSome philosophers, like John Stuart Mill, argue that freedom is more important than safety because it allows individuals to make choices and shape their own lives. Others, such as Isaiah Berlin, contend that both freedom and safety are essential, and that prioritizing one over the other may lead to unintended consequences.\n\n**In practice**, the choice between freedom and safety often depends on the specific context and the values of the individuals", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.0022213997860536, "p": 0.001340085864034224, "detected_greenlist_number": 176, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8582869172096252, "Recall": 0.851468026638031, "Accuracy": 0.8604999780654907}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8582869172096252, "Recall": 0.851468026638031, "Accuracy": 0.8604999780654907}, "total_statistics": [2465.0, 2698.0, 407.0, 430.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2465.0, 2698.0, 407.0, 430.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 0}, "prompt_idx": 7}

When scraping a website, it's essential to check if the website has a robot exclusion policy (REP) in place, which typically includes a specific IP address range that is considered unacceptable for scraping purposes. If the website has a REP, the scraper should ensure that their IP address is not within the blocked range before attempting to scrape the data.\n\nMitigation steps:\n\n*   Verify the REP in place on the website and ensure that the specified IP range is not blocked.\n*   Consider using alternative scrapers that may be exempt from the blocked IP range.\n*   Regularly monitor the website's REP and adjust the scraper accordingly to minimize potential blocks.\n\n**Risk 2: Copyright and Intellectual Property Issues**\n\nScrapping data from websites may raise concerns about copyright infringement, as the data extracted from the website could be used to create original content without permission.

He rose to fame as the lead singer and co-writer of the Jackson 5, a family group that achieved huge commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s. By his late teens, Jackson had already begun to pursue a solo music career, and his debut album in 1970 is often cited as the first pop album to be produced in a major recording studio.\n\nThroughout his career, Jackson's music spanned multiple genres, including pop, rock, R&B, and dance hall. He was known for his innovative and groundbreaking style, which combined African American musical traditions, jazz, and pop elements.

Here's a description of what it's like:\n\nWhen you first submerge your body in cold water, your skin automatically responds by constricting the blood vessels nearby to reduce blood flow to the area. As the water enters your nostrils and into the nostrils you breathe in that cold, damp air the sensation of the water is a shock to the nasal passage as the cold air hits the sensitive nerve endings in your nose. This sensation is followed by a sudden rush of cold air entering your nose and mouth, causing a jolt to your brain, which is the sensation that you get from a cold shower. You experience a feeling of sudden and profound chill that can be quite exhilarating.\n\nThe physical sensation of taking a cold shower starts when the body's response to the colder skin begins, which is a physiological response to the cold temperature that is called vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction causes blood vessels to become more contracted and is a response to reduced temperature that the body wants to conserve heat.

For nearly a century, the game has maintained its unique status as a quintessential American pastime, deserving of widespread recognition as an integral part of our collective heritage.\n\nOne of the primary reasons baseball stands out among the country's vibrant sporting options is its inherent history and cultural significance. The game originated in the northeastern United States, with the earliest recorded game being played in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1823. This pioneering spirit, born out of a shared love of sportsmanship, hard work, and communal togetherness, has infused the game with a deep-seated American quality that sets it apart from more globally-oriented pastimes.\n\nBeyond its storied past, baseball possesses a unique brand of simplicity and elegance that has captivated the American imagination since its inception. Unlike more aggressive or physically demanding sports like football or basketball, which often rely on brute strength and athleticism, baseball is an exercise in finesse, strategy, and mental toughness. Players must cultivate lightning-quick reflexes, exceptional hand-eye coordination, and a profound understanding of the game's nuances to succeed in this demanding sport.

The pyramids gained prominence under Pharaoh Khufu, with the Great Pyramid of Giza being one of the earliest and most iconic examples of this massive architectural feat. Throughout the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom periods, the pyramids continued to be built with ever-growing complexities and larger sizes, showcasing the engineering prowess and spiritual devotion of the ancient Egyptians. Ultimately, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest and still the largest pyramid, has become an enduring symbol of Egypt's rich history and grand architectural achievements. By the Ptolemaic period, the construction of the pyramids had largely become a tradition, with subsequent pharaohs building new and elaborate structures to honor the gods and secure their legacies.

The park is nestled within the U.S. state of Oregon, approximately 100 miles northwest of Salem and 230 miles southeast of Portland.\n\nThe park is situated at an elevation of 6,190 feet (1,883 meters) above sea level and is surrounded by rugged, snow-covered mountain peaks and scenic valleys. The lake itself is the deepest glacier-fed lake in the United States, with a depth of approximately 5,300 feet (1,609 meters) and a surface area of about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers).\n\n**History and Geology**\n\nThe lake was created by a cataclysmic eruption of Mount Mazama in 7,700 BCE. The volcano's explosion formed a caldera, which subsequently collapsed to create a massive crater Lake Crater. The lake has remained relatively unchanged since then, creating a pristine environment and untouched wilderness area since the 19th century.\n\n**Things to See and Do**\n\nCrater Lake National Park is a hiker's and nature lover's paradise, offering a variety of activities, including:\n\n1. **Driving the Cleetwood Cove Scenic Drive", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.04145188432738, "p": 2.6560640797090862e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 185, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8718386888504028, "Recall": 0.85892254114151, "Accuracy": 0.8676666617393494}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8718386888504028, "Recall": 0.85892254114151, "Accuracy": 0.8676666617393494}, "total_statistics": [2551.0, 2655.0, 375.0, 419.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2551.0, 2655.0, 375.0, 419.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 0}, "prompt_idx": 58}

The stages of mitosis are as follows:\n\n1. Prophase: In this stage, the replicated chromosomes condense and become visible under a microscope. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the centrioles begin to form.\n2. Metaphase: In metaphase, the chromosomes line up at the center of the cell, attached to the spindle fibers. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes.\n3. Anaphase: In anaphase, the sister chromatids (chromosomes that are still attached to each other) begin to separate, moving to opposite ends of the cell. This is where the magic happens, and the cell splits into two daughter cells.\n4. Telophase: In telophase, the nuclear envelope begins to rebuild, and the cytoplasm divides, separating the chromosomes into two daughter cells.\n5.

While animal testing has been used for centuries to advance medical knowledge, it remains a highly debated and widely criticized topic among many people and experts.\n\nThe widespread use of animal testing is often based on the simplistic assumption that animal testing is an accurate model for human physiology and disease processes. However, numerous scientific studies have revealed that animal models are not reliable, accurate, or relevant to human outcomes.

Breaking the law can be a means to achieve a greater good or protect themselves from oppressive forces.\n2. **Self-defense and protection**: Superheroes often put themselves in harm's way to protect others from villains and threats to public safety. They may be justified in breaking the law to avoid harm to innocent bystanders.\n3. **Consequences of unchecked power**: If superheroes are not held accountable for their actions, it can create a culture of impunity, where they believe they can disregard the law without consequences.\n\nArguments against allowing superheroes to break the law:\n\n1. **Accountability and checks**: Comics frequently depict superheroes being held accountable for their actions by law enforcement, the public, or other authorities. This serves as a deterrent and highlights the importance of respecting the law.\n2. **Dangers of vigilantism**: Allowing superheroes to break the law can lead to vigilantism, where individuals or groups take the law into their own hands, potentially escalating violence and creating more problems.\n3. **Potential for abuse of power**: Superheroes, as a class, have significant powers and abilities.

However, as I've navigated the complexities of this social media platform, I've come to realize that its numerous benefits are overshadowed by its significant drawbacks.\n\nFor one, Instagram's curated feed can create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, perpetuating the notion that the perfect life requires constant consumption and validation through external validation. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety among its users, particularly among young adults. The platform's emphasis on aesthetics and popularity can also foster a sense of competition and comparison, which can take a toll on mental health.\n\nAnother significant concern is Instagram's impact on the environment. The platform's massive user base means that vast amounts of plastic waste, including single-use packaging and disposable products, are generated every year. Additionally, the constant stream of advertisements is designed to drive engagement and sell products, contributing to the staggering levels of waste generated by the marketing industry.\n\nFurthermore, Instagram's influence on mental health cannot be overstated. The platform's algorithms often prioritize sensational or provocative content, which can create a snowball effect of negativity and division among users. This can lead to the amplification of toxic behaviors, such as bullying and harassment, which can have far-reaching consequences for those who experience them.\n\nIn light of these concerns, I've made the difficult decision to", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.196152422706631, "p": 1.0172773068362062e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 195, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8786739706993103, "Recall": 0.8662399053573608, "Accuracy": 0.874666690826416}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8786739706993103, "Recall": 0.8662399053573608, "Accuracy": 0.874666690826416}, "total_statistics": [2571.0, 2677.0, 355.0, 397.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2571.0, 2677.0, 355.0, 397.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 0}, "prompt_idx": 99}
