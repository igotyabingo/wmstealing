Jean-Santos is deeply influenced by his love of fine art, music, and literature, as well as his relationships with his loved ones and his own identity.

Joyce expertly weaves these stories into a single, cohesive narrative by blurring the lines between reality and fiction, as well as by employing unconventional narrative structures, including stream-of-consciousness and non-linear storytelling.\n\nThe first episode, 'Aah!

In the subsequent chapters, Joyce employs a range of narrative techniques to explore the complexities of human relationships and the tensions between desire, loneliness, and community.\n\n**Symbolism and Themes:**\nAs the novel progresses, Joyce introduces an array of symbolic and thematic elements that add depth and complexity to the narrative.

The novel tells the story of Yossarian, a bombardier in the United States Air Force stationed at a fictional Mediterranean island called Pianos during World War II.\n\nThe plot revolves around the theme of the absurdity of war and the dehumanizing effects of bureaucracy. The protagonist, Yossarian, is torn between his duty to follow orders and his sanity, as he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the war and its consequences. The novel is narrated by two sources: an Air Force officer, Captain Stone, and a nurse, Delphine Louvet, who both serve as the narrator for their respective cases of delirium tremens.\n\nThrough the eyes of Yossarian and Delphine, the novel exposes the illogical and arbitrary nature of the military regulations, particularly Catch-22. This infamous regulation states that an airman is considered insane and must be relieved of duty, but to do so requires a medical prescription from a three-star general, which cannot be obtained without taking a lie detector test that the airman must pass before the test can be administered. However, if the airman consents to the test, it will invalidate the medical assessment, rendering him insane and ineligible for relief.\n\nThe novel's title, \"Catch", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.50333209967908, "p": 3.3448111130818248e-06, "detected_greenlist_number": 189, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8793455958366394, "Recall": 0.8643215894699097, "Accuracy": 0.8734999895095825}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8793455958366394, "Recall": 0.8643215894699097, "Accuracy": 0.8734999895095825}, "total_statistics": [2580.0, 2661.0, 354.0, 405.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2580.0, 2661.0, 354.0, 405.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 0}, "prompt_idx": 37}

The novel is a poignant coming-of-age story set in Victorian London, exploring themes of poverty, morality, and the human struggle for justice.\n\nThe story follows the titular character, Oliver Twist, a poor and injured orphan who is taken in by the kindly Mr. Brownlow, the wealthy and influential member of an aristocratic family. However, Oliver's life is turned upside down when he learns that the man who raised him is a rogue and a thug, named Fagin. Fagin offers Oliver a chance to join a group of pickpockets and thieves, but Oliver eventually outsmarts them and escapes from their clutches.\n\nOliver's life is further complicated by his encounters with the corrupt and oppressive world of organized crime in London. He witnesses the brutal treatment of the working class by the aristocracy and the cruel exploitation of the vulnerable, such as Nancy, a street urchin who becomes entangled in a complex web of social and economic problems.\n\nThrough Oliver's experiences, Dickens delivers a scathing critique of the social and economic injustices of the time.

The United States has become the Republic of Gilead, a fundamentalist Christian state where women's bodies are commodified and controlled by a powerful group known as the Commanders.\n\nIn this oppressive society, women have been stripped of their reproductive rights and are forced into a rigid caste system based on their biological cycles and marital status. Those who are fertile, like handmaids, are separated from their husbands and children to ensure the continuation of a population in which the ruling class can maintain control.\n\nThe protagonist of the novel, Offred, is a handmaid who is assigned to the Commanders and their wife Serena Joy. As Offred navigates the restrictive world of Gileadian society, she reflects on her past life, her husband, and her daughter who was taken by the Commanders to a reproductive colony.\n\nThroughout the novel, Atwood uses satire and allegory to critique the dangers of patriarchal societies where women's bodies are commodified and enslaved.

The novel is known for its innovative and complex narrative structure, which blends the realistic and scientific method of Balzac's contemporaries with elements of philosophy, history, and sociology.\n\nAt its core, \"The Human Comedy\" is a critique of the social elite of 19th-century France, particularly the aristocracy and upper classes, who are portrayed as disconnected, self-absorbed, and morally bankrupt. The novel highlights the tension between the individual's desire for self-realization (represented by the characters of the protagonist, Monsieur Defarge) and the constraints of societal expectations imposed upon them.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of \"The Human Comedy\" is its exploration of the human condition through the experiences of a single family and a group of friends who are bound together through their pursuit of artistic, social, and romantic ambitions. This narrative allows Balzac to probe fundamental human questions about morality, love, and the meaning of life, often using", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.888972745734182, "p": 1.9430176356749485e-09, "detected_greenlist_number": 201, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8830000162124634, "Recall": 0.8907195925712585, "Accuracy": 0.887333333492279}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8830000162124634, "Recall": 0.8907195925712585, "Accuracy": 0.887333333492279}, "total_statistics": [2649.0, 2675.0, 351.0, 325.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2649.0, 2675.0, 351.0, 325.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 0}, "prompt_idx": 90}
