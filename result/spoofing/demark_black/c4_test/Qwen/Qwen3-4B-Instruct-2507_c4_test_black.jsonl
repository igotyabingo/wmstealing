Here's a bit more detailed information to complement your description:\n\n1. **Brightness**: With a brightness rating of 3,200 lumens, the BenQ MX525 is indeed a good choice for a budget projector. This brightness level should work well in a room with some ambient light and is suitable for presentations and home theater use in a variety of settings, particularly if the screen is relatively large (up to around 120 inches diagonal).\n\n2. **Resolution**: The projector offers XGA (1,024 by 768) resolution. While this is a step down from higher resolutions like UXGA, QCXA, or WUXGA, it is still quite capable for general use cases. It provides a clear and readable image for most media consumption and is sufficient for many types of presentations and movies.\n\n3. **Zoom**: The BenQ MX525 comes with a 1.1x zoom, which is generally considered accessible for a budget model. This modest zoom range is handy if you need some flexibility in positioning the projector for optimal viewing distance, as it allows for a 10-20% adjustment in the image size. The zoom ring is placed behind the lens, which can be slightly inconvenient if you're using a larger projection screen and need to adjust zoom from the front, but it's still manageable for most users.\n\n4. **Projection", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.0022213997860536, "p": 0.001340085864034224, "detected_greenlist_number": 176, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8119882345199585, "Recall": 0.812786877155304, "Accuracy": 0.809166669845581}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8119882345199585, "Recall": 0.812786877155304, "Accuracy": 0.809166669845581}, "total_statistics": [2479.0, 2376.0, 574.0, 571.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2479.0, 2376.0, 574.0, 571.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 1}

{"prompt": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nSurprising data show that in many places marshes protect shorelines better than walls and are cheaper to construct. Scientists are perfecting techniques for rebuilding tattered wetlands, creating custom configurations for individual shorelines. Governments and disaster planners are starting to give more consideration to living shorelines, and money to restore them is rising. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes. After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty. What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases. Gittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea. In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break. In recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine\u2019s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of \u201cgreen\u201d coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses. Around the time that Hurricane Irene was barreling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. \u201cA lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,\u201d Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and mangroves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory. The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012. Working with Risk Management Solutions, a leading risk-modeling firm, the scientists showed that wetlands prevented $625 million of flood damage from the storm, which was surprising given that the coasts in the region had already lost 60 to 90 percent of their protective wetlands over time. In areas that flooded, the few remaining wetlands lowered flood damage by 11 percent on average. As important was the ability to buffer garden-variety floods: in one local study, properties behind marshes suffered 16 percent less annual flood damage than properties that had lost their marshes. \u201cThat\u2019s well within the range for which you could expect [insurance] premium reductions,\u201d Beck points out. He and his partners then turned their economic and risk-management models on the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, which is regularly battered by big storms. They did an exhaustive analysis of the annual expected benefits and costs of all types of infrastructure. The team estimated that the coast would suffer $134 billion of losses over 20 years if no preventive measures were taken. Elevating homes could prevent $39.4 billion of those losses, but it is incredibly expensive. At an average of $83,300 per house, it would cost $54 billion to prevent that $39 billion in damages. The six-meter-high dikes being built in Louisiana were a worse option; at $33,000 per meter, they were an absurdly expensive way to protect a relatively limited amount of property, returning just $1 in savings for every $4 of expense. Smaller levees built on land in front of many low-lying coastal communities prevented much more damage for almost the same cost. In terms of bang for the buck, sandbags were the best investment, saving $8.4 billion of damages for a mere $0.84 billion in expense. Natural defenses ranked high as well. Wetlands restoration, which could prevent $18.2 billion of losses, would cost just $2 billion. Oyster-reef restoration could prevent $9.7 billion in losses for $1.3 billion. Barrier island restoration offered $5.9 billion of prevention for $1.2 billion. And \u201cbeach nourishment\u201d (replenishing depleted beaches with sand dredged from the seafloor) in the eastern Gulf could save $9.3 billion for $5.5 billion. Overall, the research found that $57.4 of the $134 billion could be prevented cost-effectively, almost all of it through green infrastructure. Cost-effective restoration may be tricky on long, sandy coasts, too. Beaches and barrier islands are by nature transient. Planting grasses to rebuild dunes can help keep beaches in place but only temporarily in many cases. At some point, residents will have to move back from the receding shoreline. One reason living shorelines are becoming an economically viable approach for coastal defense is that researchers and municipalities are getting better at rebuilding them. Early marsh-restoration designs, which followed forestry science and gave each plant plenty of space to avoid competition, were actually counterproductive. It turns out that in bare mudflats, \u201cwhen marsh plants are together, they share oxygen, so their growth rate is twice as high,\u201d says Brian Silliman, an ecologist at Duke University. Root them in large clumps, and the growth rate of each individual plant can triple. Add blue crabs, which eat the snails that eat the salt-marsh grasses, and the plants do even better. Scientists are also finding that marshes do best when they have a protective sill\u2014a linear berm that fronts the seaside edge of the grass and stands. Made of hard material such as shell, stone or concrete, its height and position are typically chosen so that water covers it at high tide, but it is exposed during low tide. The sill takes the brunt of wave energy but also traps sediment behind it, allowing the grass to thrive and marsh floor to retain its elevation or even rise. Almost any hard material can make a successful sill. Large shoreline-stabilization projects use big boulders or stackable concrete blocks, a practice that has been criticized by some experts who say that these structures are living shorelines in name only. But many lower-profile restorations integrate sills more seamlessly into the natural habitat. In the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions, marshes historically possessed a natural sill in the form of an intertidal oyster reef. Many of those reefs were overharvested long ago, ruining the sill and exposing the marshes to erosion. In these warm, oyster-friendly waters, new sills can be formed by placing a hard substrate along the low-tide line at the front edge of the marsh for baby oysters to set on. Some sites with lots of wave action have used small, hollow concrete structures or plastic mesh \u201conion bags\u201d stuffed with shell and lashed together. When successful, these artificial materials are quickly covered by oysters and disappear into the interstices of the growing reef. But the concrete often remains visible for years, and the bags have been criticized for breaking and scattering plastic through the environment. Gittman and Beck both stress the need to tailor living shorelines to local conditions. One reason oyster restoration is so cost-effective in the Gulf and the Southeast is because there have been plentiful wild oysters to seed new reefs with babies. That is not the case in most of the country. Chesapeake Bay, for example, was long the poster child for futile oyster restoration. Oyster populations in the bay had fallen to less than 1 percent of historical norms, and decades of effort and tens of millions of dollars barely budged the needle. Beck extends that lesson to coral reefs, the most underappreciated of natural defenses. \u201cCoral reefs are the single most effective ecosystem for flood-risk reduction,\u201d he says. Corals, which have evolved to take a daily pounding that would destroy most other living things, form natural seawalls exactly where you want them\u2014just offshore, in front of resorts, beach towns, coastal roads and other pricey assets. When healthy, they make remarkably effective breakwaters, reducing wave energy up to 97 percent. They are also affordable: reef restoration averages about $1,300 per meter versus $20,000 for artificial breakwater construction. The insurance industry\u2019s assessment for mitigating risk from climate change in the Caribbean found that reviving reefs and mangroves was an order of magnitude more cost-effective than seawalls or breakwaters. Even though reefs do not line a lot of shorefronts, the annual expected benefits they generate are significant\u2014more than $100 million a year in the U.S. alone and more than $400 million a year each in Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cuba. Coastal restoration may finally be getting the attention it deserves. \u201cThings are really beginning to change,\u201d Beck says. The Army Corps, which for decades has favored hardscape solutions, has launched an Engineering With Nature initiative\u2014something many planners thought they would never see. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made living shorelines a centerpiece of its coastal-resilience blueprint. Hundreds of projects have been completed or are underway around the country, ranging from shoreline stabilizations in Maryland to bulkhead removal in Puget Sound. Most are small, community-based efforts, but larger ventures are becoming more common. Stimulus funding that flowed after the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased the size of some projects significantly. Kilometers of oyster-reef projects now line Alabama, Texas and Louisiana. The flagship is Coffee Island, off the Alabama coast. The shoreline had receded up to 100 meters. The Nature Conservancy placed a three-kilometer-long line of shell bags and concrete balls about 30 meters offshore, paralleling the island. The reef immediately blocked wave energy, allowing the marsh to rebuild. Within two years approximately 200 baby oysters per square meter had colonized the structure, covering it and attracting fish, crabs and birds. Yet where there is a will\u2014and local money\u2014there is a way. The San Francisco Bay Clean Water, Pollution Prevention, and Habitat Restoration Measure, passed by Bay Area voters in 2016, raises $25 million a year for 20 years through a parcel tax. That $500 million will be used to build 40,000 hectares of wetlands\u2014the largest shoreline restoration undertaken in the U.S.\u2014using various techniques. The most novel is horizontal levees. Instead of a high, narrow mound that lines the shore, horizontal levees are broad mudflats, marshes and grasslands that gradually rise from the water\u2019s edge, sometimes for hundreds of meters back onto the land. They are graded with vast amounts of earth (often repurposed from building projects) and planted with starter plugs. They can be lower and 40 percent less costly than a traditional levee because the breadth absorbs floodwater. The configuration also gives marsh communities space to retreat as seas rise. Another encouraging sign is the Living Shorelines Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Frank Pallone, whose New Jersey district was devastated by Superstorm Sandy. The bill would designate $20 million in grants a year to living-shoreline work. A Senate version was introduced by Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California. Their prospects in the current Congress were uncertain at press time, but their existence shows that living shorelines are gaining ground. North Carolina\u2019s Coastal Resources Commission recently approved a new process that will make it as easy to obtain a living-shoreline permit as that for a bulkhead. Maryland has an even stronger law in place, requiring a homeowner to prove why a bulkhead is needed instead of a natural shoreline. Other states may follow these leads. The most promising indication of all may be the 2018 agreement made by the Nature Conservancy, the reinsurance industry and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo to create a trust fund to protect the Mesoamerican Reef, off the coast of Canc\u00fan and Puerto Morelos. The deal will include the first insurance policy ever taken out on a natural ecosystem. If the reef is damaged by a storm, insurance funds are released to rebuild its natural capital. For living shorelines to become an important part of any long-term coastal defense plan, policy makers in government, insurance and development will have to start improving and installing them before bad storms hit\u2014and funding the next round of projects through postdisaster spending afterward. That requires good science and good economic numbers\u2014which now exist\u2014as well as good proof in the form of demonstration projects, which are increasingly common. The first significant examples of postdisaster spending on natural infrastructure could occur as FEMA and other agencies look to spend more than $100 billion in recovery funds from recent hurricanes. Although FEMA\u2019s traditional hazard-mitigation investments have focused on tactics such as buying out damaged coastal homes or elevating them, the agency has adjusted its new \u201cbenefit-cost analysis\u201d policy to favor investment in natural infrastructure. Beck expects this change in emphasis to result in federally funded projects of unprecedented scope in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. Other large-scale development may soon follow worldwide as governments, disaster-risk managers, businesses, banks and insurers look to mitigate their risk exposure as cost-effectively as possible. When that happens, it will mark a moment when society realizes nature is not a luxury. It is the future.

Marshes with and without Sills Protect Estuarine Shorelines from Erosion Better Than Bulkheads during a Category 1 Hurricane. Rachel K.

World Bank, January 2016.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "raw_prompt": "Surprising data show that in many places marshes protect shorelines better than walls and are cheaper to construct. Scientists are perfecting techniques for rebuilding tattered wetlands, creating custom configurations for individual shorelines. Governments and disaster planners are starting to give more consideration to living shorelines, and money to restore them is rising. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes. After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty. What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases. Gittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea. In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break. In recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine\u2019s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of \u201cgreen\u201d coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses. Around the time that Hurricane Irene was barreling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. \u201cA lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,\u201d Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and mangroves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory. The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012. Working with Risk Management Solutions, a leading risk-modeling firm, the scientists showed that wetlands prevented $625 million of flood damage from the storm, which was surprising given that the coasts in the region had already lost 60 to 90 percent of their protective wetlands over time. In areas that flooded, the few remaining wetlands lowered flood damage by 11 percent on average. As important was the ability to buffer garden-variety floods: in one local study, properties behind marshes suffered 16 percent less annual flood damage than properties that had lost their marshes. \u201cThat\u2019s well within the range for which you could expect [insurance] premium reductions,\u201d Beck points out. He and his partners then turned their economic and risk-management models on the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, which is regularly battered by big storms. They did an exhaustive analysis of the annual expected benefits and costs of all types of infrastructure. The team estimated that the coast would suffer $134 billion of losses over 20 years if no preventive measures were taken. Elevating homes could prevent $39.4 billion of those losses, but it is incredibly expensive. At an average of $83,300 per house, it would cost $54 billion to prevent that $39 billion in damages. The six-meter-high dikes being built in Louisiana were a worse option; at $33,000 per meter, they were an absurdly expensive way to protect a relatively limited amount of property, returning just $1 in savings for every $4 of expense. Smaller levees built on land in front of many low-lying coastal communities prevented much more damage for almost the same cost. In terms of bang for the buck, sandbags were the best investment, saving $8.4 billion of damages for a mere $0.84 billion in expense. Natural defenses ranked high as well. Wetlands restoration, which could prevent $18.2 billion of losses, would cost just $2 billion. Oyster-reef restoration could prevent $9.7 billion in losses for $1.3 billion. Barrier island restoration offered $5.9 billion of prevention for $1.2 billion.

Gittman showed that natural marshes along the Outer Banks in North Carolina protected the coastline more effectively than hard structures like concrete bulkheads. Marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, retained their structural integrity and greenery, unlike the bulkheads, which suffered significant damage. This study highlighted the underestimated resilience of living shorelines.\n\n2. **Living Shorelines as a Better Alternative**: Living shorelines are composed of a variety of ecosystems including salt marshes, mangroves, and oyster reefs. These natural defenses not only help protect against hurricanes and storms but also enhance biodiversity and water quality. Studies have shown that living shorelines can reduce wave energy, protect coastlines, and even mitigate flood damages more effectively and at a lower cost than conventional gray infrastructure such as bulkheads and seawalls.\n\n3. **Economic Benefits**: The research by Michael W.

This training is expected to add considerable depth to the roster of New Zealand referees, especially valuable at the Heartland Championship level, which features the nation's most prominent domestic teams.\n\nLyndon Bray, the NZ", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.04145188432738, "p": 2.6560640797090862e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 185, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8228669166564941, "Recall": 0.8228669166564941, "Accuracy": 0.8270000219345093}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8228669166564941, "Recall": 0.8228669166564941, "Accuracy": 0.8270000219345093}, "total_statistics": [2411.0, 2551.0, 519.0, 519.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2411.0, 2551.0, 519.0, 519.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 5}

Tiger Woods has done it again. Woods is a Masters champion for the fifth time in his illustrious, storied career. After an 11-year drought, golf's most polarizing and popular figure has added another major to his dossier, outlasting a star-studded leaderboard on Sunday by posting a final round 2-under 70 to win the 2019 Masters. It's his first major win since the 2008 U.S. Open, 15th of his career and first at Augusta National since 2005. With five green jackets now in his Augusta locker, Woods is second all-time at the pristine course behind only Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Woods began the day T2 and in the final pairing for the first time since 2007, but he sat two strokes off leader Francesco Molinari, who had been steady all week. Molinari led throughout much of the day, in fact, until double-bogeys on No. 12 and No. 15 opened a small window for Tiger to pounce -- and pounce he did. Woods birdied the par-5 13th hole and par-5 15th for the third time this week, then birdied the par-3 16th with a near-hole-in-one. He walked up to No. 17 with a two-stroke lead on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, and when Koepka missed a birdie putt on 18 that would have put pressure on Woods, Tiger was able to clinch it with a bogey on the final hole. \"I was just trying to plod my way around the golf course all day, then all of a sudden I had the lead, and coming up 18, it was just trying to make a 5,\" said Woods. \"When I tapped the putt in, I don't know what I did, but I know I screamed. And then I was just looking for Joey. I shook the guys' hands and then found Joey, and it was a pretty big embrace. To have my kids there, it's come full circle. My dad was here in 1997 and now i'm the dad with two kids there.\" Woods becomes a five-time Masters winner on Sunday, which stands alone as the second-most in the sport's history ahead of Arnold Palmer. Only Jack Nicklaus, who won six, has more. The victory marks Woods' first at Augusta since 2005, when he capped an incredible decade of dominance at the event he also won in 1997, 2000 and 2001. \"It's overwhelming,\" said Woods of winning for a fifth time. \"I think just because of what has transpired, and last year i was just very lucky to be playing again. The previous dinner, the champions dinner, I was really struggling and missed a couple years of not playing this great tournament. To now be the champion, 22 years between wins is a long time. But it's just unreal for me to experience this. My mom was here, she was there in 97 as well. So I just couldn't be more happy and more excited and i'm kind of at a loss for words, really.\" Woods' fourth and final round was a roller coaster, much like the rest of the field. He began with consecutive pars before birdie-bogey-bogey on 3, 4 and 5. In his final four holes on the first nine, he tapped in two birdies to stay on pace with the leaders. His second nine was bookended by bogeys, but in between, he played the seven holes at 3-under, led by consecutive birdies on 15 and 16. Following the victory, Woods made an appearance in Butler Cabin to receive his fifth green jacket from 2018 champion Patrick Reed. Sliding on the jacket, a wry smile crept across his face.

He started the day tied for second, trailing Francesco Molinari, but Molinari's double bogeys on holes 12 and 15 provided Woods with an opportunity to take the lead.

Bill Winkenwerder, director of Eureka\u2019s parks and recreation in 1966, purchased two llamas, two peccaries and a chimpanzee through a $1,300 city allocation for the zoo for that budget year.

The documentary feels like an attempt to recoup some financial losses through a posthumous release catering to fans who might be interested in seeing the great performer one last time before the final tour.\n\nThe footage appears to have a haunting, almost eerie quality, reflecting the bittersweet sentimentality of viewing a dead artist's work. The author expresses discomfort not only with the idea of selling this material after Jackson's death, but also with the physical appearance of the performer, noting his frailty and emphasizing a stark contrast with his former youthful, commanding presence on stage. Despite the somber tone of the footage, it highlights Jackson's dedication and professionalism. His dance moves and singing are praised, suggesting that Jackson's talent and artistry, although perhaps compromised by the rehearsal context, still shine through.\n\nThe editing is described as loyalty-focused, omitting potentially negative aspects of Jackson's condition or behavior at rehearsal. This curation serves to maintain a positive image of Jackson, ensuring that viewers only see the best of performances, and possibly shielding his team from scrutiny or criticism. The phrase \"We\u2019ll get there,\" as spoken to his crew, conveys a sense of resilience and unwavering determination, which is poignantly juxtaposed against Jackson\u2019s apparent age and lack of energy in some clips.\n\n", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.5425625842204065, "p": 1.490384071711759e-08, "detected_greenlist_number": 198, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8054652214050293, "Recall": 0.8171617388725281, "Accuracy": 0.8080000281333923}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8054652214050293, "Recall": 0.8171617388725281, "Accuracy": 0.8080000281333923}, "total_statistics": [2476.0, 2372.0, 598.0, 554.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2476.0, 2372.0, 598.0, 554.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 8}

Delightfully kitschy touches add to the nostalgia, notably the antique cars parked out front. The resort is made up of four low-rise tower blocks with a mixture of interior and exterior access, and twin 12-storey towers, which include 20 two-bedroom/two bathroom suites and grandstand views over Volcano Bay. The lovable Minions from the film Despicable Me visit the resort on Fridays, which adds to the family fun. Easy access to the theme parks is the big draw, but the resort has much more to enjoy.

The resort is made up of four low-rise tower blocks with a mixture of interior and exterior access, and twin 12-storey towers, which include 20 two-bedroom/two bathroom suites and grandstand views over Volcano Bay. The lovable Minions from the film Despicable Me visit the resort on Fridays, which adds to the family fun. Easy access to the theme parks is the big draw, but the resort has much more to enjoy. The Cabana Courtyard section offers an enormous zero-entry pool with water slide and an interactive children\u2019s play area, while Lazy River Courtyard features a pool and blissful lazy river for tubing. A 10-lane bowling alley and Ace Arcade are ideal for the occasional rainy day or an evening in, and health-conscious visitors have access to state-of-the-art Jack LaLanne Fitness Studio. At parents\u2019 discretion, children can be given pre-arranged charging privileges on their room key. Bold orange, blue and green d\u00e9cor follows through on the throwback theme without feeling obtrusive or overwhelming. Standard rooms sleep four, family suites sleep six, and two-bedroom/two bathroom suites sleep up to eight. Suites feature two televisions (three in two-bedroom suites) and a well-equipped kitchenette. Split bathrooms in the standard rooms and a compartmentalised bathroom (toilet and sink in separate rooms to shower) in the Beachside/Bayside tower suites are supremely family-oriented, especially for those eager to take advantage of the early entry perk into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter sections of the theme parks. Dining is limited, but the caf\u00e9 style Bayliner Diner food court features full breakfasts or breakfast sandwiches, plus soups, salads, pizza, burgers and an international selection at lunch and dinner, including Brazilian beef, vegetarian Lo Mein and Roast Chicken, and it makes a welcome break from the higher-priced offerings at nearby CityWalk. The food court also offers a small grab-and-go section. Galaxy Bowl Restaurant and Hideaway Bar & Grill pool bar serve up basic bar fare, while Atomic Tonic pool bar blends killer cocktails and features a Mediterranean-inspired menu, including some tempting vegetarian offerings. Swizzle Lounge lobby bar plus a Starbucks top off the selection, and Delizioso Pizza does in-room delivery. Double rooms from $158 (\u00a3115) in low season; and from $269 (\u00a3195) in high season. Breakfast not included (from $2.65/\u00a32). Free Wi-Fi with the option to upgrade to premium wireless access for up to four devices. There is a $12 (\u00a39) fee for parking. Universal\u2019s Front-of-the-Queue perk is not offered to guests at this resort. Select rooms are disabled-friendly, and all public areas are accessible. With all three Universal parks practically on its doorstep, Cabana Bay can\u2019t help but be family-friendly.

These conditions can lead to severe neurological deterioration, diminished quality of life, and in some cases, even suicide, as has been tragically documented in the stories of several former NFL players.\n\nTrump's comments at the rally in Lakeland, Florida, and his broader stance on these issues are at odds with the scientific consensus about the dangers of repetitive head injuries in contact sports. CTE has been linked to repeated subconcussive impacts sustained in football, even when the injuries do not always result in a diagnosed concussion at the time of the impact.\n\nThese kinds of statements from a presidential candidate are particularly worrying because they could have a significant impact on public perception and action towards protecting the health of athletes, particularly young athletes, as well as potentially undermining ongoing efforts to improve safety in sports and reduce the incidence of these traumatic brain injuries.\n\nThe NFL and its partners have made substantial efforts to address these issues by implementing new rules and protocols to detect and manage concussions more effectively. However, the continued promotion of a culture that downplays the seriousness of head injuries can have severe consequences, not only for the individuals affected but also for society as a whole.

Athletes of pro football accomplish feats that seem impossible to us mere mortals as we watch the games unfold from the comforts of our living rooms or tucked away in the stands. With so many unique entities inhabiting the football universe, it's hard to truly decipher who the truly transcendent players are. Oddly enough, sometimes we understand it best with what disappoints us, rather than what impresses us. On Monday there was that sense of foolish disappointment looking at the box score for Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt. Wait, he only tallied 101 rushing yards in Kansas City's 29-20 victory over the Redskins? No 50-yard runs or end-zone trips? We'd come to expect more, after all, from the player who took his first 47 career carries for 401 yards and scored six total touchdowns. It's in the moments when you realize that a workhorse-like 25-touch, 121 total-yardage game internally registers as a letdown that reality sets in. Hunt is in the middle of a truly special season. The NFL just witnessed a transcendent season from a rookie running back last season. Drafting Ezekiel Elliott with the fourth-overall pick, and the subsequent selection of Dak Prescott, changed the trajectory of the Dallas Cowboys. Elliott was a tone-setter for the 2016 Cowboys, an engine for their drive to the NFC's No. 1 seed while quickly becoming the story of the season. Through four games, it's not outrageous to suggest that Hunt, a third-round draft pick, is set to have an even better campaign. All running backs are products of their environment. No rusher can truly function without proper blocking and even great backs -- see Todd Gurley's 2016 -- can be foiled when planted in a poisonous offensive soil. The mark of a good back is being able to succeed in well-established conditions and getting the yards blocked for them. The great backs are the ones who create yards beyond just what they're given. Hunt has been the best back this season at creating on his own. Through the first four games, he's gained an average of 6.1 more yards after a defender closes within one yard of him (NFL average is 3.6), leading the NFL among running backs with more than 25 carries. For comparison's sake, Elliott in 2016 averaged 4.4 yards after defenders closed within a yard of him. He ranked third in that category among backs with more than 200 carries. Elliott is a special player in the open field, a threat to break tackles and take any run for six. So far, Hunt looks like Elliott's equal in that regard. In his first few games it was easy to say that Hunt's stats were boosted by big runs. Indeed, plays like the 69-yard run against the Chargers to close out a Week 3 contest did boost his overall statistical finish. However, what we saw out of Hunt against Washington was a more sustaining runner. While the massive highlight reel runs didn't come in waves, he consistently gained positive yardage, going down for a loss on only two carries. Hunt stacked steady run after steady run, before eventually breaking two 15-plus yard plays. Kareem Hunt's #NextGenStats rushing chart from tonight. These types of consistent, offense-sustaining brand of games are what will really solidify Hunt as one of the best backs in the NFL. We all love big plays and they often flip the field to differentiate winners and losers. However, in close games when the offense needs to build up drives as the clock runs, a performance such as Hunt's latest is exactly what an NFL team looks for. Hunt was that player Monday, and he improved as an individual runner as the game went on. While he averaged 3.0 yards after a defender closed within a yard during the first two quarters, he improved to a 3.4 average in the second half. True feature backs get better as the game goes on. One area where Hunt does appear to have an edge on Elliott is in the passing game. Hunt has made several big catches in the early portions of his rookie campaign, whereas Zeke was less of a factor with less than 40 catches back in 2016. Hunt averaged 3.5 air yards per target, a notably high rate for running backs. Slot receivers like Randall Cobb and Jarvis Landry sit at 5.9 and 5.6 on the season, for comparison. Of course, if Hunt is to sustain such a special pace and truly enjoy a rookie-of-the-year campaign on par with Elliott's 2016, he'll need two more accompanying notes. The first is what all running backs need, as mentioned earlier: a little help from his friends. Elliott's blending with the Cowboys fabled offensive line made for the ingredients to an ideal dish. Elliott averaged 0.6 yards before a defender closed within a yard of him, doubling the league average of 0.3. The Next Gen Stats help to quantify the dominance of Dallas' 2016 and also help show that their decline this year is dragging Elliott back to mere mortal levels of production. Through four games, the argument can be made that Hunt enjoys an even better cast of characters opening lanes for him. The rookie back averages a whopping 1.3 yards before a defender closes within a yard of him this season. He's making the plays on his own once he gets to the second-level, so there's nothing to take away from him, but the Chiefs system and his offensive line are plowing lanes for him to show his best work. Additionally, now that the spotlight is firmly on him, Hunt will need to show he can still excel even when defenders are keying in on him. Elliott thrived in epic fashion when put to this test last season. The Cowboys and Zeke saw a stacked box (eight-plus defenders) on 28.9 percent of his carries in 2016 but it carried little weight. Elliott averaged 4.7 yards per carry on those plays, the fourth-highest among backs with 200-plus rushes. Hunt has consistently drawn that extra attention this year, seeing a stacked box on 32.4 percent of his carries. Through the first month of the 2017 campaign, it's been no damper to his ability. Hunt averages 8.0 yards per carry when facing stacked boxes this year, second-highest among backs with 20-plus carries. However, it's worth noting that Washington gave him the most trouble thus far in his NFL career. The Redskins stacked the box on 38.1 percent of Hunt's carries and he averaged just 1.9 yards per carry on those plays. Again, if this is truly going to be an Elliott 2016-type season for Hunt, Hunt will need to produce closer to his previous level in this regard. The NFL is full of surprises, but it's hard to come up with a bigger shock than the dominance of Hunt through the quarter mark of the 2017 regular season. No matter your expectations, he's exceeded them. As taken aback as we all were when Elliott took the league by storm as a rookie, it's even more outrageous to see a player drafted 82 spots later the following year do the same. It's all the more impressive that through four games, it's not outlandish to assert that Hunt is doing what Elliott did, and just might outdo him.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "raw_prompt": "Published: Oct. 3, 2017 at 01:41 a.m. Updated: Oct. 3, 2017 at 04:11 a.m. The NFL is full of undeniably special players.

He managed steady yardage and only allowed two carries to result in a loss, indicating a high level of consistency.\n\n2. **Yardage and YAC**: Hunt leads the league in yards after contact among running backs with more than 25 carries, averaging 6.1 more yards after a defender closes within one yard of him compared to the league average of 3.6. This metric, known as Yards After Contact (YAC), highlights his ability to create yardage beyond what he's initially given in the run game.\n\n3. **Passing Game Efficiency**: Hunt has been effective in the passing game, with more than 3.5 air yards per target, which is notably high for a running back. This is comparable to slot receivers like Randall Cobb and Jarvis Landry.\n\n4. **Offensive Line Support**: While Hunt's stats show his individual talent, he has been supported by an excellent offensive line.

The U.S. dollar lost ground during the overnight trade as currency traders increased their appetite for yields, and the rebound in risk sentiment is likely to drive price action throughout the North American as the economic docket remains fairly light for Monday. However, the EUR/USD pared the overnight rally to 1.4441 and the single-currency may face additional headwinds over the near-term as European policy struggle to address the risk for contagion. During the unscheduled meeting on May 6, the EU pledged to review the lending terms of the EUR 110B bailout for Greece in order to avoid the region's first sovereign debt restructuring, but the record-high financing costs faced by the European periphery will continue to bear down on market sentiment as investors fear the a breakup of the monetary union. In turn, the small correction in the single-currency could be short-lived, and the EUR/USD may continue to push lower over the near-term as it breaks out of the upward trend from earlier this year. As the euro-dollar struggles to hold above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from the 2009 high to the 2010 low around 1.4430-50, the overnight rally may taper off going into the North American trade, but speculation for higher borrowing costs may help to prop out the single-currency as the European Central Bank sticks to its one and only mandate to ensure price stability. Despite the ongoing turmoil within Europe's financial system, market participants still see the ECB raising the benchmark interest rate by 75bp over the next 12-months according to Credit Suisse overnight index swaps, and the EUR/USD may face range-bound price action in the coming days as investors weigh the prospects for future policy. The British Pound struggled to hold its ground as home prices in the U.K. marked the biggest decline in seven-months, and the GBP/USD may threaten the upward trend from earlier this year as we are likely to see the Bank of England maintain a dovish outlook in its quarterly inflation report, which is due out on May 11. As growth and inflation cools, BoE Governor Mervyn King should retain a neutral tone for future policy, and the central bank head may talk down speculation for higher borrowing in the U.K. as he aims to encourage a sustainable recovery.

However, the EUR/USD pared the overnight rally to 1.4441 and the single-currency may face additional headwinds over the near-term as European policy struggle to address the risk for contagion. During the unscheduled meeting on May 6, the EU pledged to review the lending terms of the EUR 110B bailout for Greece in order to avoid the region's first sovereign debt restructuring, but the record-high financing costs faced by the European periphery will continue to bear down on market sentiment as investors fear the a breakup of the monetary union. In turn, the small correction in the single-currency could be short-lived, and the EUR/USD may continue to push lower over the near-term as it breaks out of the upward trend from earlier this year. As the euro-dollar struggles to hold above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from the 2009 high to the 2010 low around 1.4430-50, the overnight rally may taper off going into the North American trade, but speculation for higher borrowing costs may help to prop out the single-currency as the European Central Bank sticks to its one and only mandate to ensure price stability. Despite the ongoing turmoil within Europe's financial system, market participants still see the ECB raising the benchmark interest rate by 75bp over the next 12-months according to Credit Suisse overnight index swaps, and the EUR/USD may face range-bound price action in the coming days as investors weigh the prospects for future policy. The British Pound struggled to hold its ground as home prices in the U.K. marked the biggest decline in seven-months, and the GBP/USD may threaten the upward trend from earlier this year as we are likely to see the Bank of England maintain a dovish outlook in its quarterly inflation report, which is due out on May 11.

The EUR/USD pair is currently trading around 1.4441, down slightly from a previous rally.\n- **Technical Indicator**: The euro-dollar pair is facing resistance around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at around 1.4430-50. A break below this level may signal further downside, but expectations for ECB policy may provide some support.\n- **ECB Policy**: Despite current turmoil, the expectations are still high for the ECB to hike rates by 75bp over the next 12 months, which could help stabilize the euro.\n\n### Euro (EUR) Outlook:\n- **Greece and Contagion Risk**: The EU has pledged to review the bailout terms for Greece, aiming to avoid a debt restructuring, which helps in addressing immediate concerns.

We've gotten glimpses of Corey Stoll's Yellowjacket villain from Ant-Man in a poster that debuted in December and promo art that arrived in February, but we have never seen an official image of the costume as it will be seen in the movie, until now. Entertainment Weekly has debuted a new photo as part of their summer movie preview, which gives us our best look at Yellowjacket yet, as he prepares to throw a punch at a diminutive Ant-Man. You honestly have to squint and focus to see the tiny Marvel superhero, but trust us, he's there. As you can see in the photo below, Cross' Yellowjacket costume is armed with plasma cannons, which puts Ant-Man at quite a disadvantage, although, when Ant-Man shrinks, his strength increases, according to director Peyton Reed. \"Hank Pym's Ant-Man suit doesn't have a single weapon, whereas Yellowjacket is armed with plasma cannons. Ant-Man is very fast when he's small. Also, when he shrinks, he increases his density, so he's got increased strength.\" Paul Rudd also talked about how playing Scott Lang was a completely new experience for him, since he had to wear a motion capture suit. \"It was a new experience as far as the motion-capture-suit-ness of it. But none of it feels that different. Every part, I'm pretending to be somebody I'm not. It's all just a big lie!\" Peyton Reed also shot down some recent reports that Ant-Man has already went through reshoots. The director states that there will be some additional photography, but he chalked it up to \"minor stuff.\" \"I love turning on the computer in the morning and reading the things that I did the day before-that I didn't do! We are going to do a little bit of additional photography, but we have not done any yet. It's minor stuff.\" Take a look at Yellowjacket below, and let us know what you think of this villain's look.

According to director Peyton Reed, Yellowjacket's plasma cannons and increase in strength as he shrinks could create interesting dynamics in the film, balancing Ant-Man's speed and size to potentially offer a compelling challenge and new narrative depth.\n\nThe motion capture required for playing Scott Lang, as Paul Rudd mentioned, sounds like an unusual and immersive experience. Rudd's comment about the experience being \"all just a big lie!\" suggests both the complexity and the creativity that go into crafting roles and performances for such films, where technology and imagination intersect to produce extraordinary on-screen action.\n\nRegarding the question of whether \"Ant-Man\" will be one of this summer's biggest hits, it's worth noting several factors that could contribute to its success. The franchise's potential to entertain with its unique premise of shrinking and growing in scale, combined with strong cast and recognizable talent like Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas, along with new characters like Yellowjacket, suggests a solid foundation. Additionally, Ant-Man's appeal to both the younger superhero movie crowd and nostalgic fans of the original comics could be a significant draw.\n\nWhile it's early to predict how box office success will unfold for \"Ant-Man,\" the buzz and anticipation surrounding the release indicate that it may well", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.6950417228136043, "p": 0.00010992534131915033, "detected_greenlist_number": 182, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.799066960811615, "Recall": 0.7940397262573242, "Accuracy": 0.7958333492279053}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.799066960811615, "Recall": 0.7940397262573242, "Accuracy": 0.7958333492279053}, "total_statistics": [2398.0, 2377.0, 603.0, 622.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2398.0, 2377.0, 603.0, 622.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 13}

The easing of restrictions on mortgage credit access is a significant step that reflects the following:\n\n1. **Strengthened Banking Sector Confidence**: The move by the Reserve Bank indicates that there is a growing sense of stability within the banking sector. This suggests that regulators have confidence in the health and resilience of the financial institutions, which are better equipped to provide mortgage credit.\n\n2. **Consumer Debt Burden**: It also suggests that the Reserve Bank is increasingly confident that current levels of consumer debt are manageable and sustainable, at least under the new conditions. This could be seen as a positive sign for both consumers and businesses, as it potentially opens up new opportunities for borrowing and investment.\n\n3. **Easing of Lending Restrictions**: The changes to mortgage credit access, effective from January 1, 2019, likely involve modifications to the criteria for lending, such as relaxing income requirements or interest rate caps. This can make it easier for more people to obtain mortgages, potentially stimulating the housing market and encouraging broader economic activity.\n\n4. **Economic Impact**: By relaxing credit restrictions, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is likely aiming to support the economy, particularly the real estate sector, and to stimulate broader economic growth.

This shift, while lucrative and bringing in new challenges, has also brought a deeper emotional connection with his customers, as the store now deals not only in hunting trophies but also in preserving the memories of beloved pets.\n\nThe process of freeze-drying animals is significantly less labor-intensive and more cost-effective compared to traditional methods, particularly for smaller animals. This makes it a popular choice for pet owners. The high initial setup costs for freeze-dryers have since been offset by the growing number of customers, with pets being preserved and transported from various states across the country.\n\nDespite the financial success, Mike and his staff have had to adapt to a shift in the emotional dynamics of the clientele. The store, which once buzzed with excitement over hunting trophies, now faces a different kind of visit. Pet owners, many of whom bring their pets or the stories they have to tell, often arrive in tears.

RFA recently learned that the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has accused him of espionage on behalf of unnamed foreign powers. RFA contacted Liem in Ho Chi Minh City and spoke with him on the morning of August 28. The interview was aired in its entirety on August 28 during the 9 to 10 p.m. broadcast to Vietnam. Among his remarks to RFA's Vietnamese service, Le Quang Liem, 80, shared several important pieces of information. The government of Vietnam accuses him, through an intensive press campaign, of being the henchman of foreign powers to plot the \"overthrow of the legal and constitutional government of Vietnam.\" This campaign began in April. Conversely, the CPV had also informally sought Liem's cooperation to be made chairman of an advisory committee on religious questions. \"I have refused and said it will not do. Why, they asked me. I said that... a religion should be independent and not be an appurtenance of the government. Let them organize a public conference gathering all the major leaders of the Hoa Hao in the nation - the conference can even be presided over by a government person - and let them present their opinions. Only then can we know what they want. And to start with, the government should not interfere or try to guide them one way or the other. This will not do.\" He also spoke of his rebuff of an attempt to draw him into a scheme that would have embarrassed the government on April 30 - the anniversary of the fall of Saigon. In response to the suggestion Liem said, \"my stand is a purely religious stand, I do not engage in politics and I do not cause disturbances. My struggle, while very tough, is also non-violent. I believe that all violence and sabotage only causes misery to people and harms them.\" Even if a grenade can kill a communist leader, he would be replaced right away by another, according to Mr. Liem. \"That is why I believe that killing people is not the solution whereas the real need of the Vietnamese people at the present time is freedom, the restoration of freedom. Now, freedom and human rights happen to be the main trend of the whole world. That is why we should struggle...to get the support of the whole world and force a change of direction on the communist regime, so that they have to grant the people their basic freedoms. That is the main point.\" Le Quang Liem also said he does not believe in the establishment of a government-in-exile especially since the main powers, including the United States, have changed direction from military confrontation to a policy of peaceful engagement. \"As for the distribution of leaflets, grenade throwing, setting off land mines or other explosives, these are all murderous weapons killing the innocent. That is a crime and I am incapable of such a crime.\" In closing, Liem said: \"They want to come for me? I am ready. I tell you, I am not sure where my struggle will lead me, and it's sort of doubtful that I will be able to help my church very much. I might end up in jail or even get killed, it's all equal to me.\" RFA just learned that yesterday, August 28, Nguyen Van Dien, second in command to Le Quang Liem, has been arrested by the authorities - possibly in connection with the same charge leveled at Liem.

Le Quang Liem, aged 80 and a long-standing leader of the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church, has been accused by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) of espionage in an effort to undermine the government. This allegation, which emerged in April, forms the backdrop to the interview, where Liem strongly repudiated the charges, emphasizing his dedication to religious independence and non-violent means of protest.\n\nLiem's rejection of attempts to involve him in schemes that would embarrass the government on key historical anniversaries like April 30, the fall of Saigon, underscores his stance against political agitation. In a broader sense, his statements reflect the broader struggle for freedom and human rights in Vietnam, positioning the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church as part of a larger global movement advocating for these values. Liem asserts that the core issue is the restriction of basic freedoms under the current regime and the necessity of garnering global support to effect change.\n\nThe fact that Nguye Van Dien, described as the second-in-command to Liem and also a prominent Hoa Hao leader, has been arrested along with Liem adds a grim dimension to the narrative, as it suggests a possible escalation in the state's crackdown on religious leaders critical of the regime.

The funding, totaling $140 million, includes several projects aimed at relieving traffic on key freeways and roads within the state.

Another $10 million is dedicated to improving roads in Eltham, and $30 million for upgrading Ballarto Road in Skye.\n\nAccording to Morrison, this funding comes with the expectation that the Victorian state government will contribute matching funds, with the exception of one project. He emphasized that such investments aim to reduce commute times and enhance the overall quality of life for Victorians, noting that the funding is already part of the existing budget.\n\nHowever, the announcement has sparked some debate, particularly with the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who was initially supportive but raised concerns about the balance in federal-state partnerships. Andrews highlighted that the state needs a fair share of the costs for infrastructure projects, though he was initially pleased that the national leader was considering Victoria's traffic issues. His tone, however, turned slightly critical when mentioning the federal government's previous election giveaways and suggested that a more collaborative approach would be beneficial, especially regarding significant projects like the $3 billion budgeted for the failed East West Link project.\n\nThe Opposition Leader, Michael O'Brien, echoed Andrews' stance, urging Andrews to", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.9259818304894547, "p": 4.318833797356536e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 184, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8118069171905518, "Recall": 0.8357958197593689, "Accuracy": 0.8223333358764648}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8118069171905518, "Recall": 0.8357958197593689, "Accuracy": 0.8223333358764648}, "total_statistics": [2489.0, 2445.0, 577.0, 489.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2489.0, 2445.0, 577.0, 489.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 19}

He urged these leaders to return to a righteous path, emphasizing that the nation's future can still be bright if leaders remain true to their duties.\n\nAdditionally, the passage mentions that Dr. Mahathir has yet to decide whether he will attend a mass rally in Kuala Lumpur organized by the Bersih electoral reform group. This rally calls for the resignation of current Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is under scrutiny over allegations of illegal transfers to his personal bank accounts. Dr. Mahathir, known for being one of the harshest critics of Prime Minister Najib, has repeatedly called for Najib's resignation. In contrast, Prime Minister Najib maintains his innocence and denies having used any state funds for personal gain.\n\nThe dialogue highlights the ongoing political tensions in Malaysia, with former and current leaders differing in opinion regarding the nation's leadership and the direction it should take.

This gym is 1954 \u2013 frozen in time. Plopped in the middle of a tiny town \u2014 population 419 \u2014 in the southwest corner of Montgomery County, the gym is a reminder of a time when basketball ruled. Waveland was a powerhouse in the 1950s. No one in the county could beat the Hornets. The stage at the end of the gym, meant for school plays, had folding chairs on Friday nights, seats for fans when the bleachers were packed to the walls. People would pour out into the school halls on tiptoes, trying to catch a glimpse of the action.

They are dust-covered reminders of the the chili suppers that took place before home games, when townswomen brought in their cream pies and chocolate steam cakes. The locker rooms are suffocating, barely wide enough for two players going opposite directions to pass. One toilet. Two urinals. A dozen metal lockers. The windows in the dank basement are shut now. But in the 1950s, players would leave them unlatched so they could sneak in to shoot in the dark gym. The producers of \u201cHoosiers\u201d saw the magic. They came to visit the gym, built in 1937, in the early 1980s. They saw the perfect spot to film their iconic movie based on the Milan miracle of 1954. But the timing didn\u2019t work out. And no one in Waveland knew. They had no idea what their little pocket of Indiana was missing out on. The school board got the request from Angelo Pizzo, an unknown writer and filmmaker from Bloomington, who was working on his first movie. The premise of the film: A small town Indiana school wins a state basketball championship, featuring the fictional team of Hickory Huskers, which was loosely based on the real 1954 Milan team. But the Waveland board had already signed contracts and the town had passed a bond to demolish the old school attached to the gym and build an elementary school. \"We were looking for one location where we could shoot it all,\" Pizzo said in the book \"Historic Hoosier Gyms,\" written by IndyStar's Kyle Neddenriep. \"The school, the downtown square, the gym \u2014 all of it. We found the perfect place at Waveland.\" But despite pleas from Pizzo and his partner, David Anspaugh, to hold off on the construction, Waveland voted no to \"Hoosiers\" being filmed at their gym. \"Unfortunately we got word of 'Hoosiers' a little too late,\" said Mike Mitchell, who was on the school board at the time. \"It\u2019s too bad, because Waveland had everything we needed \u2014 the town, the gym, the school,\" Anspaugh said years later. Instead, the fictional town of Hickory was shot in three different locations: New Richmond, Nineveh and, for the gym, Knightstown. That Knightstown gym, now called The Hoosier Gym, has reinvented itself into a museum and community center. The Waveland gym, vacant and full of so many memories, is up for auction next month. It is being sold with the now-vacated elementary school. \"That gym was a big deal to the community,\" said Ralph Jones, who owns the property with his wife, Brenda. The couple had tried for several years to get a charter or Christian school going. \"That's what I'd like to see happen,\" Jones said. \"Outside of that, as long as it\u2019s good for the community, then it's good with me.\" Other have talked of turning the gym and school into a community center or, perhaps, offices. Mitchell, who was a standout player at Waveland in the 1960s and ended his career as the second-leading scorer in school history with 1,473 career points, said he is torn about the sale of the gym. \"I have no idea what it should be. I hate to see it just decay,\" said Mitchell, who was also the first Waveland player to achieve a 50-point game. \"I\u2019ve seen a few gyms that have been abandoned over the years and I guess they kind of die a slow death. I would hate to see that happen to it.\" The Waveland Hornets had incredible success from 1949 to 1953, winning the sectionals four times. They were 25-0 in 1951 before losing 50-49 to Covington in the regional final at Clinton. \"It was very much like Hoosiers,\" said Mitchell, who grew up next to the Waveland gym. Keith Greve was a star of the team during that era and went on to start four years at Butler University, playing for Tony Hinkle. He was later inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. His brother, Bill Greve, graduated as the career scoring leader at Waveland and in Montgomery County history with 1,777 points. That placed him fifth in Indiana high school basketball history when he graduated in 1955. He went on to play four years for Purdue and was inducted this year into Indiana's hall of fame. There was most certainly magic that happened inside that gym \u2014 whether it ever made it to the big screen or not. \"You wouldn't believe the stuff I get to see,\" said Paul Miner, who works for Lawson & Co., the auction company that is selling the property, as he looks up at the vintage scoreboard hanging in the gym. \"Yep. This is what Indiana basketball was about.\" The Waveland gym was last used as a high school gym in 1971, when the school consolidated with Ladoga and New Market to form Southmont that year. From then on, it was part of the elementary school. But when the elementary school was demolished in the 1980s to make way for a new one, the gym remained. No one wanted to see it go. Built in 1937, the Waveland gym was a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The school at the time was kindergarten through 12th grade \u2014 about 250 students total. Many of the graduating classes had 13 to 15 students, said Dave Fullenwider, who attended Waveland until it was consolidated in 1971. Through the years, so much has happened inside that gym. Fall carnivals, Christmas programs, community meetings. Fullenwider said in the 1950s, on Friday nights, two ticket booths would set up outside of the gym. People would line up along the sidewalk to buy tickets to the game before school let out. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, the gym remained packed for basketball. \"'Hoosiers' (producers) came in there and said the town was perfect, the school was perfect, the gym was perfect,\" said Fullenwider. \"A first grade teacher at the time said, 'They were dying to film here.'\" Alas, that didn't happen.

Despite its significant role in local sports history and its perfect setting for a cinematic masterpiece, fate conspired against Waveland when filmmakers sought to film a movie based on the iconic Milan miracle.\n\nBuilt in 1937, the gym exemplifies the essence of Indiana school gyms, boasting wooden bleachers, peeling brick walls, and a stage originally designed for school plays, which transformed into a focal point for basketball fans on Friday nights. The musty smells, wooden doors, and the stage with folding chairs all paint a vivid picture of the community's passion for the sport. The gym's appeal lies not only in its unique architecture but also in the memories it holds\u2014such as the chili suppers and cream pies brought in by townswomen before games, and the practice sessions that players would sneak in after the lights were turned off in the basement.\n\nWhen the opportunity arose to film the movie \"Hoosiers,\" the Waveland gym seemed like the perfect backdrop.

He wrote the speech that Ronald Reagan, poised dramatically under a bust of Lenin, delivered to students at Moscow State University. The event was a highpoint of the Moscow summit. Now Josh Gilder is working for George Bush - crafting the first of many speeches which he hopes will help put the vice-president over the top in the fall elections. ``I'm struggling with the transition, because I'm writing for a candidate versus the President,'' says the youthful Mr. Gilder, even though he is not a newcomer to the Bush operation. He worked as a Bush speechriter for two years before being tapped for the presidential job in late 1985. The struggle is understandable. The President's delivery is so impeccable that even a bad speech can be made to sound good. Vice-President Bush, on the other hand, does not have the reputation of a good speaker, especially when he is viewed on television. Bush, he adds, although he is younger than Reagan, is a more old-fashioned politician who got his experience on the stump in Texas, delivering extemporaneous remarks on the back of a pick-up truck five times a day. Reagan, by contrast, is a politician of the television age. If Bush does not come through well on TV, says Gilder, his strengths lie in his knowledge of the issues and the fact that he is an honest man. ``He couldn't dissemble if he tried,'' says the speechwriter. It is clear that Gilder already is thinking in terms of Bush as a doer, perhaps in response to the Democrats' effort to build up Dukakis as a pragmatic manager. ``Reagan is the great visionary and Bush is the man that can implement that vision,'' he says. He cites the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Arms) Treaty. The ``vision'' was the two-track policy of negotiation and deployment that led to the treaty. But it was George Bush who convinced the allies to move ahead with deployment of the nuclear missiles in the face of domestic opposition. A political speechwriter does not make up his own ideas, of course. He seeks to capture and embody his client's views and values. In the case of Reagan, says Gilder, he went back to the President's 1964 ``A Time for Choice'' speech in support of Barry Goldwater to understand his most fundamental views. It helps, of course, to share those views. Although he attended Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts institution where he studied literature and music, Gilder is an unabashed conservative. After graduation he wrote for such conservative periodicals as American Spectator, the Wall Street Journal, and New Criterion. After joining the White House in 1983, Gilder's first speech for Bush was for a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating entrepreneurs. Later he wrote more substantial pieces, including the speech Bush delivered at a foreign policy conference in Vienna in 1983 on Yalta, in which he declared that the West would never accept the division of Europe. During his two years with Bush, he says, the vice-president penned a great deal himself. Sometimes he wrote out his ideas on a legal pad aboard a plane and handed it to a writer for crafting just before a public appearance. There is an art to writing for presidents and politicians. Gilder takes issue on which - when writing for someone for who is not a brilliant speaker - short, choppy sentences are called for. Speechwriting for the President is not a solo operation. A draft speech is vetted by many people, from White House and National Security Council aides to State and Defense officials. All can and often do suggest changes. Finally, the draft is shown to the President himself, who frequently makes substantive as well as editorial changes. While the White House has a stable of writers, many of whom earn a reputation in their own right, they do not tout their authorship of presidential speeches. The whole idea is to fashion a speech which, infused with the President's ideas and delivered with the rhythm uniquely his own, becomes ``his'' speech. In working on the speech, Gilder sought advice from James Billington, head of the Library of Congress and author of ``Icon and the Ax.'' He also talked with Yakov Smirnov, the Soviet 'emigr'e and standup comic who is becoming known to US audiences for his witty comments about Soviet society. The President, Gilder says, wanted to talk about the importance of freedom and what it means. Yakov, he says, helped make the theme concrete in terms of Soviets' own experience. Reagan ended up talking about freedom in churches, freedom in the schoolroom, freedom in the courtroom. He mentioned his own experience leading a union strike as president of the Screen Actors Guild. ``We are breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny,'' the President declared. Drawing on ideas uttered by Reagan over the decades, Gilder sought to make the speech not a ``challenge'' to the Soviet students, he says, but an ``embrace of the possibilities'' if the USSR opened up its system. Reagan praised Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform effort and voiced hope for its success. Reagan's speech was laced with the names of literary and other figures, among them Gogol, Pasternak, Lomonosov, George Washington. Even an Uzbek poet - Alisher Navoi. Though Reagan could not have known about all of them, the name-dropping had a purpose. The Gilder draft went into circulation twice and, unlike many other speeches, ``sailed through,'' with a few presidential changes Gilder declined to describe. For Gilder, the challenge now is to find Bush's words.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "raw_prompt": "Josh Gilder put himself on the map recently.

Later he wrote more substantial pieces, including the speech Bush delivered at a foreign policy conference in Vienna in 1983 on Yalta, in which he declared that the West would never accept the division of Europe. During his two years with Bush, he says, the vice-president penned a great deal himself. Sometimes he wrote out his ideas on a legal pad aboard a plane and handed it to a writer for crafting just before a public appearance. There is an art to writing for presidents and politicians. Gilder takes issue on which - when writing for someone for who is not a brilliant speaker - short, choppy sentences are called for. Speechwriting for the President is not a solo operation. A draft speech is vetted by many people, from White House and National Security Council aides to State and Defense officials. All can and often do suggest changes. Finally, the draft is shown to the President himself, who frequently makes substantive as well as editorial changes. While the White House has a stable of writers, many of whom earn a reputation in their own right, they do not tout their authorship of presidential speeches. The whole idea is to fashion a speech which, infused with the President's ideas and delivered with the rhythm uniquely his own, becomes ``his'' speech. In working on the speech, Gilder sought advice from James Billington, head of the Library of Congress and author of ``Icon and the Ax.'' He also talked with Yakov Smirnov, the Soviet 'emigr'e and standup comic who is becoming known to US audiences for his witty comments about Soviet society. The President, Gilder says, wanted to talk about the importance of freedom and what it means. Yakov, he says, helped make the theme concrete in terms of Soviets' own experience. Reagan ended up talking about freedom in churches, freedom in the schoolroom, freedom in the courtroom. He mentioned his own experience leading a union strike as president of the Screen Actors Guild. ``We are breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny,'' the President declared. Drawing on ideas uttered by Reagan over the decades, Gilder sought to make the speech not a ``challenge'' to the Soviet students, he says, but an ``embrace of the possibilities'' if the USSR opened up its system. Reagan praised Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform effort and voiced hope for its success. Reagan's speech was laced with the names of literary and other figures, among them Gogol, Pasternak, Lomonosov, George Washington. Even an Uzbek poet - Alisher Navoi. Though Reagan could not have known about all of them, the name-dropping had a purpose. The Gilder draft went into circulation twice and, unlike many other speeches, ``sailed through,'' with a few presidential changes Gilder declined to describe. For Gilder, the challenge now is to find Bush's words.", "generated_text": "Josh Gilder's role as a speechwriter for both Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush illuminates the complexities and nuances involved in crafting presidential rhetoric. As a youthful and experienced speechwriter, Gilder has navigated the transition from Reagan to Bush, each of whom brings a unique personality and set of political challenges to the task of public speaking.\n\nReagan's speech at Moscow State University in 1988 exemplifies the power of a well-crafted, presidentially-delivered speech. Gilda's approach to Reagan's speech was to capture and refine the ideas that defined Reagan's presidency, particularly focusing on themes of freedom and human dignity. He drew upon Reagan's extensive political career and his ability to connect with audiences, especially the youth in a Cold War context. The use of names and references to cultural and historical figures not only showcased Reagan's broad knowledge but also provided the Soviet audience with an accessible connection to American culture, subtly undermining the ideological divide.\n\nGilder's perspective on Bush highlights the challenges a non-blas\u00e9 speaker faces compared to a more naturally charismatic figure like Reagan. Bush\u2019s strengths lie in his knowledge of and commitment to policy, his integrity, and his practical, down-to-earth approach. In contrast, Bush may struggle more with spontaneous, extemporaneous speeches in favor of well-rehearsed and carefully crafted messages. This difference presents a unique set of challenges for Gilder, who must adapt the style and tone of the speech to fit Bush's personality and", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.849742261192856, "p": 6.181100019597707e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 192, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8211544752120972, "Recall": 0.8029363751411438, "Accuracy": 0.8100000023841858}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8211544752120972, "Recall": 0.8029363751411438, "Accuracy": 0.8100000023841858}, "total_statistics": [2461.0, 2399.0, 536.0, 604.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2461.0, 2399.0, 536.0, 604.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 29}

DOJ says Officer Erik O'Brien fired fatal shot. GREEN BAY - A Green Bay man who was shot and killed Friday by Green Bay Police had been arrested earlier that night on a warrant for failing to report to jail for a 2017 drunken driving conviction. Jonathon C. Tubby, 26, was identified by the state Department of Justice on Friday as the man shot and killed Oct. 19 in the sally port at the Brown County Jail. The sally port is an enclosed, garage-like area where officers drive in, park and walk suspects to and from the jail. Two Green Bay Police officers, Erik O\u2019Brien and Colton Wernecke, are on paid administrative pending the outcome of an investigation of the shooting by DOJ's Division of Criminal Investigation. State law requires the investigation of police shootings be conducted by an outside agency. O'Brien was the only officer to fire his weapon during the incident, DOJ said. O'Brien is a six-year veteran of the department. Wernecke is a trainee with three months on the job. No other information about the shooting has been made public. The family asked for prayers, encouragement and support, in a statement released Friday by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. They also asked the community to respect their privacy and to refrain from speculation about the events surrounding Tubby's death. \"Through the night there have been stories and recollections of Jonathon and what a compassionate caring young man he was. Jonathon loved to dance, sing, and make people laugh. He was compassionate and took care of everybody he loved the best he could. He was very athletic and enjoyed football and lacrosse,\" the family's statement said. Tubby and a woman who has not been named by police were arrested for outstanding warrants during a traffic stop about 7:20 p.m. Oct. 19, near the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in the 300 block of Main Street, police said. Court records show a warrant for Tubby's arrest was issued in May after he failed to report to jail to serve a 60-day sentence for a May 2017 conviction of second-time drunken driving. Officers became concerned about Tubby's behavior while driving him to the Brown County Jail, according to online police radio archives. He was shot and died shortly after 9 p.m. In a statement, the DOJ said a large number of police officers were present when Tubby was shot because of the length of the incident at the jail. The investigation is expected to take about 60 days to complete. Police radio transmissions posted online shed some light on what happened the night of Tubby's death, including an 8:30 p.m. call in which an officer told the county dispatch center that Tubby had, \"something in his shirt, pointed up at his chin.\" About 8:55 p.m., officers reported being unable to see Tubby's face in the patrol car. At 9:11 p.m., a call went out to Green Bay Metro Fire for a rescue squad \"for possible shots fired\" at the jail. Around 9:20 p.m. officers asked for the medical examiner to be sent to the jail.

I'm in the less-is-more camp, with both the dress and the crab cake. This summer, I'm on the hunt for the best places in Delaware to get a crab cake. While this isn't a new quest, it's been almost 10 years since our last Great Crab Cake search. I started at a perennial favorite, Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar in Lewes. The restaurant has been well-known for its crab cakes for more than 15 years and it remains a strong contender as a place to go for a memorable crab cake experience. Keep reading for more on Gilligan's. In my experience, Delaware diners seem to prefer patties made with sweet, unbroken hunks of colossal, jumbo lump, lump or back fin meat. The less said about claw meat, the better. Classic crab cake recipes can include crumbled saltines, eggs, mayonnaise, lemon butter and even bread soaked in milk.

We'll check out your suggestions and feature some of the best ones throughout the summer. Email me at ptalorico@delawareonline.com. Almost every successful restaurant in Delaware has some kind of dish with crab meat. It's a staple of Mid-Atlantic cuisine, especially in the First State since the blue crab is common in all of Delaware's tidal waters. Crabbing also is a popular recreational resource and the blue crab tops the list of the state\u2019s economically important marine fish and shellfish. In Delaware, the blue crab season generally runs from the beginning of March through the end of November. Availability is dependent on the weather. Crab cakes can be on the pricey side because of the labor involved in getting the perishable meat. An average blue crab weighs about 1/3 pound, but the edible portion is quite low. An experienced crab picker can produce about 2 1/4 ounces of meat from each pound of live blue crabs, according to information from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. This is just about a 14 percent yield. The actual yield depends on the size of the individual crab and experience of the crab picker. Crab processors on the Eastern Shore have said they are worried about shortages and escalating prices this season because many plants don't have enough workers to pick crab meat, according to a story last month in The Baltimore Sun. The meat the employees pick is sold in area markets and to restaurants. Workers, who mostly come from Mexico, can't get visas due to a new lottery system started by the Trump administration, The Sun reported. Previously, visas were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Prices could rise throughout the summer as demand grows greater. Cheryl Tilton, owner of Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar, says crab meat prices recently have been \"through the roof.\" Tilton only uses jumbo lump crab meat for her crab cakes and usually purchases the meat from the Lewes Fishhouse or Samuels & Son Seafood Co., a wholesale restaurant supplier based in Philadelphia. The cost has been $28 a pound. \"I like the big lumps of crab meat,\" she says. \"We're hoping that we at least get through the season. There is a shortage.\" Joe Lasprogata, vice president of Samuels & Sons, says area restaurants buy both fresh and pasteurized crab meat. \"Both products are extremely expensive right now,\" he says. \"It's a crazy demand. We can't get enough live crabs. There's a huge demand in this area.\" Fresh crab meat is pricey because it's extremely perishable. \"It has to be used immediately,\" Lasprogata says. Pasteurized crab meat, which is easier for restaurants to use because it lasts longer and has no shells, usually comes from China, the Philippines and Indonesia, he says. Crab prices usually remain high throughout the summer, and then fall in September and October. While the crab cakes at Gilligan's have always been a high point of the eatery's menu, it had been years since I had one. If you haven't been there lately, the restaurant at 134 W. Market St. has undergone a complete transformation. When it reopened last year, the year-round business, next to the Inn at Canal Square, had a completely new look. The original restaurant had been built around a dry-docked, 38-foot cabin cruiser rescued from the Florida Keys, a corn crib salvaged from a historic building in Ellendale and a former chicken coop. But Tilton said she was tired of working in a building that was falling down around her, so that structure was razed. Now, a new building is in its place. Gilligan's has 62-seats indoors and 68-seats outdoor and a harbor view that overlooks the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal. There's also a private dining room that be rented for events like wedding rehearsal dinners and baby showers. The marina atmosphere fuels the urge for seafood. We pre-gamed with an appetizer of steamed Little Neck Clams ($13) immersed in a briny, brothy wine bath flecked with sweet corn and soppressata, a slightly spicy Italian cured meat. It's a very good beginning to a meal, though the \"crusty\" bread was almost too crusty. Leaving it to soften in their irresistible broth didn't help much. Not wanting to risk a possible trip to the dentist, we asked for replacement bread. But our server said all the bread that was available was just as \"crusty\" because it was made ahead of time. But we were really here for the crab cakes, and they did not disappoint. Calling Gilligan's crab concoction a cake is really a misnomer. This is a \"flash-fried\" crab ball that is, perhaps, just slightly smaller than a baseball. \"It's pretty big,\" Tilton says of the portion that's close to 10 ounces. \"Even though the prices have gone up, we still want to offer the same quality.\" Tilton says she has been using the same recipe \"as I've done all the time, since we started here 16 years ago.\" The jumbo lump crab meat is held together with only a whisper of mayonnaise. Then, it's rolled into panko breadcrumbs. Tilton says each cake is put into a fryer \"really quick,\" just so it gets crispy on the outside. \"That's the best way,\" she says. Believe her. The filling is all crab, pure and simple. It's a very ample portion and I could have easily split one with a friend. A crab cake sandwich, which comes with homemade potato chips, is $20. A crab cake entree, available after 5 p.m., is $30. It's served with fingerling potatoes and \"whatever seasonal vegetables we have,\" Tilton says. You also can get a crab cake (crab ball?) on a bed of greens or, for an extra charge, on top one of the restaurant's salads. I like the Power House Salad ($12), greens tossed with sliced avocado and carrots, along with chickpeas, alfalfa sprouts and cooked barley. Tilton says the restaurant's kitchen staff makes the crab cakes every morning for that day's service. She can also make them without the panko breadcrumbs, but only with advance notice. \"We have a few customers that are gluten-free and they call in advance. If you call in advance, and let's us know you're coming, and you've been here before, we can do it.\"<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "raw_prompt": "Calling the jumbo lump crab concoction at Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar in Lewes a cake is a misnomer.

The large portion size aligns with the idea of less-is-more where the crab is the star ingredient.\n3. **Preparation Method**: They are flash-fried to achieve a crispy exterior and retain the moist and pure crab filling inside. The secret to achieving the correct crispiness is said to be the speed of frying.\n4. **Toppings and Bindings**: The filling is primarily crab meat, held together by only a whisper of mayonnaise. Panko breadcrumbs are then rolled over the cakes for a touch of texture, ensuring the crab cakes still maintain their authenticity in terms of simplicity and crab-centric appeal.\n5. **Serving and Pricing Options**:\n   - **Crab Cake Sandwich**: $20, comes with homemade potato chips.\n   - **Crab Cake as an Entree**: $30, typically served after 5 p.m., with", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.4641016151377544, "p": 0.00026600275256960515, "detected_greenlist_number": 180, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7890933156013489, "Recall": 0.7958913445472717, "Accuracy": 0.7903333306312561}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7890933156013489, "Recall": 0.7958913445472717, "Accuracy": 0.7903333306312561}, "total_statistics": [2402.0, 2340.0, 642.0, 616.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2402.0, 2340.0, 642.0, 616.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 34}

This includes disclosures related to employment and compensation practices, particularly for large public companies. These filings can include forms such as the 10-K (annual report), 10-Q (quarterly report), and proxy statements.

Google might be concerned about the potential market implications if a major player like Google were to lose significant market share due to an acquisition such as this.

They are met with curiosity, indifference and open hostility. Jewish Israeli, Palestinian, and international activists carried three black panels bearing some 100 names through the streets of what is now the Givat Shaul neighborhood of West Jerusalem on Thursday. They marched to commemorate the massacre and displacement of the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin by Zionist militias 66 years ago on April 9, 1948. Organized by the Israeli organization Zochrot, whose name means \u201cremembering,\u201d the event memorialized those killed and recounted the village\u2019s history to Israeli passers-by, who were at times curious, indifferent and hostile. A woman passing the procession as it assembled on Kanfey Nesharim Street complained to her companion, \u201cOh, it must be that Deir Yassin crap.\u201d A young worker in a sandwich shop asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d and snapped a photo with his iPhone. Just three days prior, vandals had spray-painted \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d on grave markers in Deir Yassin\u2019s cemetery. As the participants carried the names along what was once the main street of a thriving Palestinian village, it was most often children who stopped to listen to Zochrot\u2019s Umar Al-Ghubari recount the significance of a particular location along the way, or to read the names of the dead. The Deir Yassin massacre was a pivotal moment of the Nakba and in the lead-up to the 1948 War. Some 100-200 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed by the extremist Zionist militias the Irgun (Etzel) and Stern Gang (Lehi). Some were shot in battle, others executed. Others were killed when grenades were thrown into their houses. In some cases, whole families were gunned down. Exact numbers of the dead were disputed from the start, as even the perpetrators of the massacre inflated the death toll in order to sow terror throughout other Palestinian communities so that they would flee their homes. Other villages did indeed flee in fear, but the massacre also cemented the motivation of neighboring Arab countries to fight rather than accept partition. A member of the Hagana Zionist militia present for Thursday\u2019s procession recounted his role in the massacre: removing the bodies after the Irgun and Stern Gang had done most of the dirty work. He described it as the worst thing he ever experienced. My grandmother\u2019s cousin, Naziha Radwan, was six at the time of the massacre. She survived by covering herself in her grandmother\u2019s blood, hiding beneath stiffened bodies and pretending to be dead. It was hard to imagine these horrific events taking place on what now is a busy city street lined with shops and restaurants, eventually terminating in a park with playgrounds, basketball courts, and the Kfar Shaul mental hospital, whose buildings include a few of the original homes that were once the center of the village. Across the valley lies the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. In the aftermath of the massacre, prominent Jewish scholars, including Martin Buber, urged Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to leave Deir Yassin uninhabited, or at least that its settlement be postponed, writing that it had become \u201cinfamous throughout the Jewish world, the Arab world and the whole world.\u201d Their repeated messages were ignored. Prior to the massacre, we were on good terms with the Jews in Givat Shaul. We shared food, celebrated together, paid condolences to one another, babysat for each other. There was peace here before the Zionists came and destroyed everything. Zochrot\u2019s mission is \u201cto challenge the Israeli Jewish public\u2019s preconceptions and promote awareness, political and cultural change within it to create the conditions for the Return of Palestinian Refugees and a shared life in this country.\u201d While getting the Israeli Jewish public to acknowledge the injustices of the Nakba in general and the massacre of Deir Yassin in particular may be an unpopular uphill battle, a shared life based on a just and lasting peace will not be possible without such truth-telling. The British National Archives released in April last year, contained a report written by Sir Alan Cunningham, the last High Commissionar of the British Mandate authority in Palestine, dated April 30, 1948. In the report Cunningham mentioned the massacre at Deir Yassin by calling the Jewish militia which carried the massacre, \u201cterrorists, Nazis and savages\u201d. Our one eyed Rehmat strikes again. Obviously Arabs did die in Deir Yassin. That is beyond dispute. But was it an atrocity? And if it was, then was it exaggerated out of all proportion? According to some Arab notables and eye witnesses, it certainly WAS exaggerated.

Vacation plans are naturally \"SMART.\" They are Specific, Measurable, Assigned, Realistic and Time-Bound. Pick the place, set the date, pay for the trip and go. If you think about it, none of us really have 365 days a year to work. Weekends and work holidays erase more than 100. What you really have is 200 days a year to make it happen. Plan and prioritize accordingly. 2. Create recurring and passive income streams. Are you beholden to billable hours? Then you don't own a business \u2014 you have a job with no paid vacation. I productized my service so clients can subscribe by credit card. Now I get paid even while I'm away. Paying percentage points to my processing vendors is worth it. If you hate billing and collections like I do, create subscribers, not customers. Passive income is even better (via investments, affiliate arrangements, etc.). 4. Hire the right partners, managers and experts. You and your team should be able to work from anywhere. Captain Jean-Luc Picard had his number one. Who's yours? Hire your No. 1 as quickly as possible to help out when you're away. He or she can be a virtual assistant, but a vested right-hand COO \"commander\" has worked better for me. All of my businesses have been partnerships. Like marriages, making them work is worth it. 5. Identify vulnerabilities and continuously improve. Nothing shows cracks in your processes like going on vacation. Of course, this presumes your team follows standard operating procedures. But it's your responsibility as the owner to work on your business systems, as Michael Gerber advises. Systems are more than just checklists. Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline, wants us to leverage our systems' interdependencies. The best systems create whole value beyond the sum of its parts. A business is a system of systems; it's much more valuable when the owner isn't its key vulnerability. 6. Return refreshed and rejuvenated. Some of our vacations are more hectic than day-to-day business life. And many of us return to more work piled up than before. But disconnecting from daily work is supposed to help us reconnect with our purpose, passion and priorities. I like to allow myself a one-day staycation after a trip. I find that it\u2019s worth it to regroup. How else do you unwind and ramp up? I also find it reassuring to check my email while I\u2019m away (though going \u201coff the grid\u201d has its own cachet). It helps to assure me that things are OK and things are being handled.

I also find it reassuring to check my email while I\u2019m away (though going \u201coff the grid\u201d has its own cachet). It helps to assure me that things are OK and things are being handled. I can poke and ping when highly necessary. Encourage your own staff and clients to go on vacation. They\u2019ll let you go too. \u201cGoing on vacation\u201d can lead to a whole new way of business governance. You may not be able to fly away immediately but buy your non-refundable tickets anyway.

Here are some additional techniques that can complement what you\u2019ve already outlined, particularly focusing on the six areas you mentioned:\n\n### 1. Prioritize Your Vacation as a SMART Goal\n\n- **Visual Aids and Reminders**: Create a vision board or digital reminders of your vacation destination to keep the excitement alive and serve as motivation.\n- **Vacation Bucket List**: Make a bucket list that includes specific activities, local attractions, or experiences you want to have during your vacation. This can add to the excitement and give a structured itinerary.\n\n### 2. Create Recurring and Passive Income Streams\n\n- **Automate Billing**: Consider automating your billing processes with software tools to reduce dependency on manual invoicing and payment collection.\n- **Sponsorship and Branding**: If applicable, explore sponsorship opportunities or branding deals to generate passive income that can help support your vacations and lifestyle.\n\n### 3. Hire the Right Partners, Managers, and Experts\n\n- **Remote Hiring Tools**: Leverage tools like Indeed, LinkedIn, or specialized platforms to hire talent who can work remotely from any location.\n- **Virtual Interviews and Onboarding**: Opt for digital onboarding processes to ensure that new hires are properly trained to work efficiently even when you\u2019re not around.\n\n### 4.

In times of economic crisis, companies are quick to slash IT costs. With fears of a recession looming over the corporate world, CIOs are facing the axe once again. But no matter how many times CIOs proclaim their strategic value--or the strategic value of their departments--businesses too often view IT as a cost, plain and simple. IT executives have been rallying against that perception for years, but they're getting little attention. Howard Rubin says it's about time that changed. An IT benchmarking pioneer and self-proclaimed \"metrics arms dealer,\" Rubin is a former fellow with corporate strategy consultancy Norton, Nolan & Co., where he developed metrics for application portfolios and helped create the balanced business scorecard. He also serves as a senior adviser to Gartner and a research affiliate to the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management. A former executive vice president of META Group and professor emeritus of computer science at Hunter College of the City University of New York, Rubin has been an IT adviser to the U.S., Canadian, Indian and other governments. Rubin says businesses see better results when they make sound IT investments during economic downturns. When they don't, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. And the cost of catching up, he says, can be insurmountable. But CIOs are as guilty as their bosses in misinterpreting the true value of IT investments. To turn the tables, Rubin says, IT executives must recast the conventional language around IT expenditures and strategy. Rubin recently spoke with CIO Insight online editor Brian P. Watson about what companies do wrong in valuing their IT investments, and what CIOs must do to change that perception. What follows is an edited transcript of their discussion. CIO INSIGHT: What's the biggest problem today with the way companies view their IT investments? Rubin: It's been a long-term problem: Most companies view their IT investment as a cost and therefore they try to minimize the cost. Corporate leaders always ask me how they can use benchmarks to compare themselves with their peers, and how they can compare against best in class. Best in class, in conventional wisdom, is typically who's doing IT for the least amount of dollars, relative to revenue, relative to operating expense. Best in class sometimes is synonymous with who's the low cost in IT. That's a big problem, because the low cost may not be the best user of IT. When people talk about understanding how to calibrate themselves, they need to redefine best in class in terms of the aspirations of the business. Best in class could be, what's the spending pattern of the companies that are most profitable in our industry the last three years, or what are the spending patterns of the companies that have increased their business performance earnings per share the last three years? Companies treat IT like a cost and look for outside validation to drive costs down. They really should be looking at the outcome. What should I do with my IT strategy, my IT investment; am I maximizing return? That's better from a business perspective. Companies understand that IT produces value. But they view IT as a cost because it's so much harder to figure out where the value shows up in terms they can get their hands on. They gravitate to what's tangible, and what's tangible is the budget item. When you look at annual reports, go to \"operating expense.\" First you find \"compensation,\" and then you find \"communications and technology.\" IT, also through accounting principles, just makes itself look like a cost.

Here are the key points and solutions he suggests to address this challenge:\n\n1. **Reframe the Definition of \"Best in Class\":**\n   - Instead of seeking the company with the lowest IT costs, CIOs and CEOs need to define \"best in class\" based on business outcomes rather than IT expense. This could involve identifying organizations that have achieved the highest profitability or business performance metrics over a given period, as measured by earnings per share, revenue growth, customer satisfaction, or innovation.\n   - By aligning IT metrics with business performance metrics, companies can better gauge the return on their IT investment and justify strategic investments during economic downturns.\n\n2. **Shift Focus from Cost to Outcome:**\n   - Companies need to move away from viewing IT as a cost and instead focus on how it drives business value. For example, a company that is highly reliant on IT for customer engagement and supply chain efficiency may realize greater business value than one that only sees IT as an operational cost.\n   - Encouraging CIOs to quantify the impact of IT on key business metrics (e.g., increased customer acquisition, cost reductions, improved operational efficiency) can help shift this focus.\n\n3. **Address the Visibility and Tangibility Challenge:**\n   - While the tangible nature of IT costs makes it", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.965212315030781, "p": 3.431297577183301e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 193, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8249832987785339, "Recall": 0.8087753653526306, "Accuracy": 0.8153333067893982}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8249832987785339, "Recall": 0.8087753653526306, "Accuracy": 0.8153333067893982}, "total_statistics": [2470.0, 2422.0, 524.0, 584.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2470.0, 2422.0, 524.0, 584.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 42}

Here are some key points that summarize the situation and insights provided in the text:\n\n1. **Current Situation for Starting Scrumhalf**:\n   - Faf de Klerk is the incumbent starting scrumhalf for the Springboks because he had proven his worth and form, and Rassie Erasmus trusted him for the international season to begin with.\n   - However, de Klerk's return to Sale during the end-of-year tour created a situation where Erasmus needed other players to step up, particularly Embrose Papier and Ivan van Zyl, who did well but are not confirmed starters for the Bulls.\n\n2. **Role for Schreuder**:\n   - Being the captain, Schreuder is almost guaranteed a starting spot if he stays injury-free and maintains his form, giving Erasmus a full hour of game time to assess him in the second half of matches.\n   - Schreuder's experience as a regular starter provides Erasmus with a consistent performer, which is crucial in world-class competition where substitutes need to be of the highest calibre.\n   - The uncertainty around Papier's and van Zyl\u2019s status adds another layer of complexity to the selection process, especially considering the demands of international rugby.\n\n3. **Other Candidates and Competition**:\n  ", "detection_result": {"z_score": 2.0784609690826525, "p": 0.018833461114314387, "detected_greenlist_number": 168, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7978863716125488, "Recall": 0.8069472312927246, "Accuracy": 0.8016666769981384}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7978863716125488, "Recall": 0.8069472312927246, "Accuracy": 0.8016666769981384}, "total_statistics": [2416.0, 2394.0, 612.0, 578.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2416.0, 2394.0, 612.0, 578.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 43}

Walker did not rule on the claim of jury misconduct and left open the possibility that he would hear testimony from jurors on the issue later. Walker also did not rule on Hubbard's motion for a new trial during this morning's hearing, which lasted about two hours. The judge denied prosecutors' request to order Hubbard to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the state. A Lee County jury convicted Hubbard on 12 felony ethics charges in June. Walker sentenced him to four years in prison and ordered him to pay $210,000 in fines. Hubbard, who is out on bond, attended this morning's hearing. In July, Hubbard's lawyers filed a motion asking for an investigation after a juror gave the defense a sworn statement saying that other jurors made comments during the trial indicating a bias against Hubbard. Hubbard's motion asks for an investigation by the Lee County Sheriff's Department or \"another similarly situated neutral law enforcement agency.\" Walker, however, said he found no precedent in case law for such an investigation and that he was not inclined to be a \"pioneer.\" Walker said he was prepared to hear testimony on the matter, including from the juror who gave the affidavit. Hubbard attorney Bill Baxley said the defense was not prepared to call witnesses today but wanted, instead, to let the sheriff investigate and present findings to the court. This morning, Walker called to the witness stand two bailiffs who worked the case. In response to questions from the judge, both said they did not hear witnesses discussing the case. The two said they alternated sitting beside the jury box during the trial. Walker also called Court Administrator Patricia Campbell to the witness stand. The juror who gave the affidavit alleging jury bias brought those concerns to Campbell during the trial, according to the affidavit. Campbell testified today that a juror told her that another juror was making comments in the jury box such as \"uh huh,\" \"yes\" and \"now the truth is coming out.\" Campbell said she told Walker, who directed her to tell a bailiff to speak with the juror making the comments. That bailiff, Bobby Bond, testified that Campbell told him to talk to a juror who was making comments under her breath. Bond said he called the juror aside and told her not to do that. Bond said no other complaints about the jury were brought to his attention. Hubbard's lawyers pressed their claim of jury misconduct after hearing today's testimony. \"There's no way Mike Hubbard got a fair trial,\" attorney Lance Bell told Walker. Prosecutors have said Hubbard is seeking an \"unfettered fishing expedition into the jury\" by his request for an investigation. They say the affidavit alleging misconduct is inadmissible because rules of evidence exclude juror testimony about \"internal influences\" on the jury. Before Walker sentenced Hubbard, prosecutors asked him to order Hubbard to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the state under the reasoning that the state was the victim of his crimes. Walker rejected that argument before sentencing and did so again today. The amount, $1.1 million, was the total amount of consulting contract payments and business investments Hubbard received from the transactions for which he was convicted. Prosecutors had argued that Hubbard should not be allowed to keep \"ill-gotten gains obtained as a result of breaching the public's trust.\" \"It would be a just order for this court to enter because this defendant has no legitimate right to that money,\" Deputy Attorney General Mike Duffy told Walker. Baxley called their request a \"ludicrous claim,\" saying that Hubbard's case did not involve taking any money from the state or any payments made by the state. \"They're just seeking a windfall and trying to be vindictive,\" Baxley said. Baxley told Walker the strongest reason that a new trial is justified was the testimony of former Ethics Commission Executive Director Jim Sumner. Sumner testified as an expert witness for the state. He testified about finer points of the ethics law, including the definition of \"principal,\" the legal term for a person or business that hires a lobbyist, and about what kind of transactions would be covered under a friendship exception in the ethics law. Baxley said the defense was not properly notified of Sumner's expert testimony and had no chance to try to rebut it. \"We were blindsided, bushwhacked and ambushed,\" Baxley said. Among Hubbard's convictions are that he solicited and received investments of $150,000 for his debt-strapped Craftmaster Printers business from each of four business executives. The jury found the investments violated the ethics law prohibition against a public official receiving a thing of value from a principal because the four men were officials in companies that employ lobbyists. Three of the four, Great Southern Wood President Jimmy Rane, Hoar Construction President Robert Burton and former Business Council of Alabama Chairman Will Brooke, all testified that they were longtime friends of Hubbard. Hubbard's lawyers argue that the friendship exception should have applied to their investments in Hubbard's business and the transactions were not crimes. Assistant Attorney General Megan Fitzpatrick said the jury made the determination of whether the friendship exception applied after hearing all the testimony and evidence. Walker asked prosecutors about Rane's investment in Craftmaster Printers, noting that Rane testified that Rane and Hubbard had been friends since the 1980s. Rane made the investment from personal funds, not his company's funds. \"Where is the connection between Great Southern Wood and Craftmaster?\" Walker asked prosecutors. Kirkpatrick told the judge that Rane's status as a principal did not change because he used personal funds to make the investment. She noted that a transaction does not have to be a \"quid pro quo,\" an official action in exchange for money or a favor, to be a crime under the ethics law. Sumner had testified that the friendship exception was intended to apply to exchanges like gifts or shared expenses on a joint vacation. Deputy Attorney General Duffy told Walker said Alabama has the \"toughest ethics law in the country\" because it defines individuals who are officials with companies that hire lobbyists as principals, not just the companies themselves. Otherwise, Duffy said there would be a loophole in the law because those officials could reimburse themselves with company funds for individual transactions.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "raw_prompt": "Lee County Circuit Judge Jacob Walker today denied the request of former House Speaker Mike Hubbard's lawyers for a sheriff's investigation into possible misconduct by the jury that convicted Hubbard.

In a \u2018clutch\u2019 move, the entity has swooped in to save the day and sponsor the remaining unsponsored races of the Ignite race meet this weekend at the South Dakota Circuit. Mohamed\u2019s Enterprise has been an avid supporter of motor racing locally, having aided the event at crucial times in the past. A member from the club noted that the entity has been a long standing and loyal benefactor regardless of the event, and their input this time around is unquantifiable. A comment from representatives stated that they value motor racing heavily and their support comes from their love of the sport. Mohamed\u2019s Enterprise is home to the Team Mohamed\u2019s Enterprise which features the National Drag Strip record holder Godzilla, the Nissan GTR. Having won the 2018 Drag racing championship as well, the team is no stranger to the spotlight, having won the 2017 Seaboard Marine Caribbean Motor Racing Championship super stock class. Apart from that, the team holds the super stock lap records in Jamaica, Barbados, and Guyana as well as the circuit record for motorcycles here. This time around, they look set to retain that title with South Dakota record holder Matt Truelove and his brother Harry aboard their Yamaha R6s. The team\u2019s third rider is factory Suzuki daredevil, Richard Cooper who is aiming to reset the record set by Truelove last year. Ignite, will double as the final leg of the Seaboard Marine Caribbean Motor Racing Championships (CMRC) will feature competitors out of Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, United States and Europe. The two days of racing action will feature competition in the Street and Sport Tuner class as well as the CHOKE Starlet Cup, Street Cross Motor-Cycles and the 125cc Lightweight Bikes. On the regional scene, the Groups 2-4 action as well as the super stock, and the Radical Caribbean Cup are expected to feature over the two days of action. Tickets for the 27-race programme are on sale at the cost of $2500; children $1000 at B.M. Soat Auto Sales, Croal Street office. Tomorrow, time trials for all classes begin at 10:00hrs followed by official races in the Street Cross Motorcycle, 125cc Motorcycle, Street Tuner, Choke Starlet Cup and Sports Tuner from 13:20hrs.

People love to whine. In Stalinist Russia, though it could be deadly, there was a culture of public complaint. Stores might not have had items on the shelves, but they did have comment books. Criticism and self-criticism were practices not only encouraged, but outright demanded of conscious citizens. Thankfully, the stakes are not so high for my peers. They can gripe about the way their grueling workout routines have not yet rewarded them with the body they want, a body that society is supposedly brainwashing them into believing is beautiful\u2014and no one cares.

I know this because I\u2019ve done my fair share of sobbing into the virtual void and no one said anything about it to my face. The only problem is that, while the behavior may now seem appropriate, whining will forever be a petty, unpleasant, primitive mode of expressing oneself.

Ineptitude is never amusing in its own right. When compared to maturity and success, it may be a joke or a cautionary tale. When everyone is a bungling wreck, though, there\u2019s no point in mentioning it. Yet we still mention it. We may cheerfully claim that nobody\u2019s perfect, but we still hold fast to a certain vision of perfection. Otherwise, there would be no need to comment on our shortcomings. The ideal person would still seem to be someone with composure, a self-controlled specimen of high esteem. Someone who never gets sick, never goes broke, never falters, never cries. That person may not exist, but we obviously still hope it\u2019s a state we can achieve. Why else would we whine when we\u2019re not healthy, happy, and self-possessed? Why bother making a note of every single sore throat? Every instant we are sloppy, unsuccessful attempts at sophisticated human beings?

This real-time communication can foster a sense of community, but also perpetuate a culture of immediate gratification and public airing of grievances.\n   - The anonymity provided by these platforms sometimes encourages more raw and unfiltered expression, which might not occur face-to-face.\n\n2. **Psychological and Social Factors**:\n   - There is a psychological drive to seek validation through social interaction, even if that interaction consists of sharing one's struggles and frustrations.\n   - Social comparison on platforms like Facebook and Instagram can create a sense of inadequacy, leading individuals to constantly seek reassurance by sharing their own shortcomings.\n\n3. **Cultural Expectations and Pressure**:\n   - In contemporary society, there is an immense pressure to project a sense of perfection through social media, which in turn fuels the opposite impulse to reveal one's imperfections and struggles.\n   - The cult of individualism and self-improvement can sometimes lead to self-criticism and public displays of vulnerability as a way to establish one's authenticity and relatability.\n\n4", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.427092530382482, "p": 2.8639718707701434e-08, "detected_greenlist_number": 197, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7951527237892151, "Recall": 0.7852458953857422, "Accuracy": 0.7879999876022339}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7951527237892151, "Recall": 0.7852458953857422, "Accuracy": 0.7879999876022339}, "total_statistics": [2395.0, 2333.0, 617.0, 655.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2395.0, 2333.0, 617.0, 655.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 49}

Here\u2019s a summary and analysis of the key issues and perspectives:\n\n### Key Ecological Issues\n\n1. **Invasive Plant Species**:\n   - **European Beachgrass and Scotch Broom**: These non-native plants are aggressively colonizing the dunes, creating thick, dense vegetation that alters the landscape and ecosystem. They can grow quickly, up to 5 feet per year in some areas.\n   - **Shore Pine**: Introductions of these trees by humans have also contributed to the proliferation of vegetation, creating linear formations that disrupt the dune's natural ecosystem.\n\n2. **Man-Made Stabilization Attempts**:\n   - Over the past several decades, government agencies, particularly the U.S. Forest Service, have attempted to stabilize dune areas by planting these non-native species. This was done to prevent dune erosion around towns or ports and to build infrastructure.\n   - The introduction of these trees and shrubs has significantly altered the natural dynamics of the dune system, leading to the formation of a foredune that traps additional moisture, eventually creating wetlands from what were once open dunes.\n\n### Human Factors and OHV Trails\n\n1. **Illicit OHV Trails**:\n   - Off-highway vehicle (OHV) users have established unauthorized trails that cut across the dunes, often in areas dominated by invasive species.\n   -", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.5795716689756794, "p": 0.0001720789269232803, "detected_greenlist_number": 181, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7876690030097961, "Recall": 0.7939514517784119, "Accuracy": 0.7893333435058594}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7876690030097961, "Recall": 0.7939514517784119, "Accuracy": 0.7893333435058594}, "total_statistics": [2389.0, 2347.0, 644.0, 620.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2389.0, 2347.0, 644.0, 620.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 50}

Let's break down the three steps and add a bit more context and some additional tips from best practices in SEO for those facing ranking changes due to an algorithm update.\n\n### Roger Monti's Steps for Dealing with Google Algorithm Changes\n\n1. **Do Not Panic and Wait for a Month:**\n   - **Why:** Google is known for constantly refining its algorithms, and minor tweaks can have a ripple effect that might be temporary. Waiting gives Google time to fully roll out the updates and possibly make additional adjustments.\n   - **Action:** Keep an eye on your site\u2019s performance but stay calm. Focus on gathering data and analytics from the month to see how your traffic and rankings are affected.\n\n2. **Analyze and Tweak When Rankings Fail to Return:**\n   - **Why:** If the initial impact from the algorithm change leads to a significant drop in rankings, it might be time to reassess the strategies that were previously successful and adapt them to align with the current ranking factors.\n   - **Action:** Use tools like Google\u2019s Search Console to identify which pages are being affected and why. Look at the top-ranking pages and see what makes them successful. Then, tweak your pages to align with their strategies. Consider factors like content relevancy, page structure, and user experience.\n\n3. **Seek Input from a Trusted SEO Expert:**\n   - **Why:** It can be difficult to see your website", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.849742261192856, "p": 6.181100019597707e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 192, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8121272325515747, "Recall": 0.8022913336753845, "Accuracy": 0.8048333525657654}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8121272325515747, "Recall": 0.8022913336753845, "Accuracy": 0.8048333525657654}, "total_statistics": [2451.0, 2378.0, 567.0, 604.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2451.0, 2378.0, 567.0, 604.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 51}

The president of the Greek Cypriot administration in southern Cyprus fired the chief of his police force on Thursday, accusing him of incompetence after Greek Cypriot right-wing extremists disrupted an event involving the former presdient of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Supporters of ELAM, a far-right Greek Cypriot group which describes itself as an affiliate of the Golden Dawn party of Greece, attempted on Wednesday evening to gatecrash a university debate featuring former Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat on reunification. Cyprus's Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities have lived apart since the island was split in a 1974 Turkish invasion following a brief Greek-inspired coup.

Mehmet Ali Talat has consistently maintained a pro-peace stance and has taken significant steps towards the reunification of Cyprus in subsequent years. The events of 1974 are indeed a complex and contentious period in Cyprus history, involving a series of political, military, and civilian actions that led to the division of the island. Talat has repeatedly rejected any association with the violent and brutal actions that occurred during the events of 1974.\n\nThe Cypriot conflict and the division of the island between the two communities, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, are the result of several overlapping factors, including political aspirations, historical grievances, and military interventions.

This method of using leaks to influence public perception has been a significant tactic in his campaign strategy.\n\n2. **Controversy Over Russian Involvement**: Despite the apparent discomfort expressed by Kellyanne Conway, there is ongoing scrutiny regarding whether Russian officials, particularly President Putin, were behind these actions. The U.S. intelligence community has been particularly vocal about attributing the cyberattacks to Russia. This assertion by U.S. officials contrasts with Trump\u2019s repeated claims and denials regarding Russian involvement.\n\n3. **Charge of Interference and Puppetry**: During the debate, Clinton challenged Trump over his willingness to condemn Russian interference in the US election.

Three days after Brock Osweiler\u2019s impressive showing in Seattle \u2014 arguably his best showing as a pro \u2014 Nuggets coach Michael Malone, general manager Tim Connelly and other team assistants and staff members attended the Broncos\u2019 training camp practice at Dove Valley. And Osweiler, for obviously reasons, caught Malone\u2019s eye. Malone spent some time with Broncos general manager John Elway during practice and, afterward, had a lengthy conversation with Kubiak about coaching \u2014 and getting fired. Kubiak was let go by the Houston Texans in 2013, and Malone by the Sacramento Kings last December. \u201cWe talked about myself being fired in Sac, when he got fired in Houston, and how it really does make you stronger and makes you a better coach at the next opportunity that you get,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe\u2019re just really thankful for the time that they allowed us here today. Malone stayed for the full practice, watching intently from the sideline as Osweiler and Peyton Manning led the team through 11-on-11 drills, and Joe DeCamillis coordinated three special teams periods. He watched as Von Miller tore through offensive linemen during one-on-one drills. And he watched as backup receiver Bennie Fowler hauled in a couple more deep catches, as follows to his 41-yard grab Friday. But Malone couldn\u2019t escape Dove Valley without fielding questions about the Ty Lawson trade last month.

Do something, anything! I\u2019ve never seen that work out well. Faried one of their best players? Do you watch him on defense? Do you see him clank 15 foot shots over and over again? Do you see him on the free throw line with an important shot to make, and constantly miss? Oh, you see the dunks when the game is no longer on the line, the playing to the crowd, and the posturing for the cameras. My 10 year-old-neighbor boy goes for that too.

I trust Coach K\u2019s assessment of Faried\u2019s game more than yours or the other naysayers. Faried plays with passion & effort, he helps the team. I have no doubt that if Coach Malone does a decent job, he\u2019ll improve Faried\u2019s game. Faried\u2019s improved his game every year. It\u2019s a farce that some people think he\u2019s a problem, when it\u2019s clear he\u2019s one of the top assets on this team. Oh god, the NBA clueless Kizla again. I\u2019ve had other more important things to do recently than post here but please. I agree that Faried is one of the better assets on a bad team.

He doesn\u2019t have the physical abilities to be a serious starting power forward. He\u2019s a top bench player on a contending team.

Notably, one key focus is on how Malone\u2019s past experience of being fired might influence interactions with Coach Gary Kubiak, who was also recently fired by the Houston Texans. The article also touches on speculation regarding the coaching future of both Kubiak and Michael Malone, and Malone\u2019s observations and comments about certain players on the roster of both teams.\n\nRegarding Nene (likely a reference to Mason Plumlee, commonly known as \"Faried\" in the context of Denver's roster changes) specifically, there is significant disagreement over his role and contributions to the team. Malone supports Nene's value and believes he plays key roles in both offense and defense. However, others argue that Nene's defensive and shooting performances, as well as his recent missed free throws, indicate underperformance.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the context: Malone expresses his belief that Nene\u2019s contributions are positive and that he should not be seen as a problem, whereas some fans and commentators find fault with Nene's recent form and his fit within the team's rebuilding goals. Malone appears to trust in Nene\u2019s potential for improvement and value, suggesting that better coaching and team support could boost Nene\u2019s performance and help the team succeed in rebuilding towards future championship aspirations. The core of the debate revolves around how best to balance talent with team chemistry and strategic fit in a rebuilding phase. \n\nFor a", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.965212315030781, "p": 3.431297577183301e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 193, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8309950828552246, "Recall": 0.842819333076477, "Accuracy": 0.8345000147819519}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8309950828552246, "Recall": 0.842819333076477, "Accuracy": 0.8345000147819519}, "total_statistics": [2547.0, 2460.0, 518.0, 475.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2547.0, 2460.0, 518.0, 475.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 57}

The constitutional amendment was approved Tuesday by nearly 70 percent. Voters also took the first to two steps to allow marijuana to be used to cure illnesses or relieve pain. In Colorado and Washington, medical marijuana measures passed, but one in Arizona was rejected. There were 10 questions on the ballot and seven passed. Rejected was Question 8 to bounce the lieutenant governor from the job as president of the Senate where he or she steers the course of debate. Also turned down were Question 6 to allow a tax break on property that conserved water and Question 7 that would have imposed a sales tax on items purchased from local government stores. There was overwhelming approval for Question 5 to limit the length of the Legislature, which in 1995 and 1997, both lasted 169 days. Senate Majority Leader William Raggio, R-Reno, a leading proponent, said leadership has already set a timetable to conduct its business within the 120 day limit. There will be deadlines for each house to pass its bills, except in certain cases. And committee actions must be taken by certain dates. The 1997 session cost a record $15.5 million, and this is expected to reduce the cost several million dollars. Although opposed by most law enforcement officer, Question 9 on medical marijuana handily won passage 58-41 percent. But it must be approved again at the 2000 election before it is written into the Constitution. It is patterned after the California initiative, which has run into trouble from federal law enforcement officials. But the Justice Department has agreed to take another look at the possibility of allowing a government-supervised use of marijuana as a treatment for certain sick people. This would be a major reversal of the policy of the department, which since January has filed suit seeking to close at least six California \"marijuana clubs\" that supply members, including disease sufferers, with the drug. --Question 1: changed the Constitution to resolve a conflict when competing issues appear on the election ballot and both win. The one with the most votes is considered victorious. --Question 2: Removed the state Judicial Discipline Commission from under the authority of the Nevada Supreme Court and put it under the Legislature. The commission was given more independence in setting its rules and has the authority now to open investigations without waiting for a complaint. --Question 3: The Legislature is now empowered to allow district judges to hold court outside the county seat. The impetus for the change came from Nye County where the population center of Pahrump is more than 100 miles from Tonopah, the county seat. But this could apply in Clark County to such places as Laughlin and Mesquite. --Question 4: An advisory ballot issue whether Nevada Day should be changed from Oct. 31 to the last Friday in October so there will be a three-day weekend. It will be up to the 1999 Legislature to change the law, if it wants. --Question 17: The Nevada Constitution will now have the so-called \"scarlet letter\" on term limits. It requires Nevada's Congressional delegation and state legislators to push for term limits for Congress either through a constitutional amendment or a constitutional convention. Those who did not follow this direction would have a notation placed beside their names on election ballots.

This would be a major reversal of the policy of the department, which since January has filed suit seeking to close at least six California \"marijuana clubs\" that supply members, including disease sufferers, with the drug. --Question 1: changed the Constitution to resolve a conflict when competing issues appear on the election ballot and both win. The one with the most votes is considered victorious. --Question 2: Removed the state Judicial Discipline Commission from under the authority of the Nevada Supreme Court and put it under the Legislature. The commission was given more independence in setting its rules and has the authority now to open investigations without waiting for a complaint. --Question 3: The Legislature is now empowered to allow district judges to hold court outside the county seat. The impetus for the change came from Nye County where the population center of Pahrump is more than 100 miles from Tonopah, the county seat. But this could apply in Clark County to such places as Laughlin and Mesquite. --Question 4: An advisory ballot issue whether Nevada Day should be changed from Oct. 31 to the last Friday in October so there will be a three-day weekend. It will be up to the 1999 Legislature to change the law, if it wants. --Question 17: The Nevada Constitution will now have the so-called \"scarlet letter\" on term limits. It requires Nevada's Congressional delegation and state legislators to push for term limits for Congress either through a constitutional amendment or a constitutional convention. Those who did not follow this direction would have a notation placed beside their names on election ballots.

This is aimed at reducing legislative costs and increasing efficiency. The amendment is significant as it requires the Legislature to act within a strict timeline, mandating deadlines for committee actions and full passage of bills by the respective houses.\n\n2. **Medical Marijuana (Question 9)**: This was narrowly approved but with a strong margin, allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes. However, it requires further approval in the next election (2000) to be written into the state's Constitution. The measure is patterned after the California model for medical marijuana use, which is currently under federal scrutiny. The passage of this ballot measure could have a significant impact on state and federal policies related to marijuana regulation.\n\n3. **Amendment to Voting Rules (Question 1)**: While not directly related to specific legislation, this amendment provides a mechanism for resolving conflicts when multiple issues on the ballot both pass, ensuring a clear victor based on the highest vote count. This simplifies the decision-making process in instances of tie results.\n\n4. **Independent Judicial Discipline Commission (Question 2)**: This measure shifts the authority and governance of the state's Judicial", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.9259818304894547, "p": 4.318833797356536e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 184, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8188818097114563, "Recall": 0.8147901296615601, "Accuracy": 0.8171666860580444}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8188818097114563, "Recall": 0.8147901296615601, "Accuracy": 0.8171666860580444}, "total_statistics": [2446.0, 2457.0, 541.0, 556.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2446.0, 2457.0, 541.0, 556.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 60}

The project in Zambia, which involves extensive land clearance for road-building, exemplifies the scale and pace of these development initiatives. While the work provides local employment, there is a sense of ambivalence among the workers, who often feel exploited or marginalized by the strict and often brutal management practices of Chinese contractors. One particularly poignant scene shows a worker interacting with a manager through a fence, highlighting the divide between them.\n\nAnother key narrative strand follows Zambia\u2019s trade minister on a trip to China. The minister\u2019s experience is a critical component of the film, illustrating how Chinese companies can offer rapid and efficient solutions that may seem alluring to developing nations facing infrastructure deficits. The swift delivery of investment projects and the perceived stability of Chinese enterprises in what can be volatile political and economic climates is portrayed as a significant draw for Zambian officials.\n\nThe directors adopt a restrained and observational approach, allowing the subjects and their experiences to speak for themselves.

But why do we celebrate Easter and why is it so late this year? Easter is only days away with many getting ready for some time off work and school thanks to the bank holiday in the UK. The holiday, which is celebrated across the world, will start with Good Friday on April 19 and end on Easter Monday on April 22. Then celebration means Britons can soon tuck into copious amounts of chocolate eggs - but do you know why Easter is being celebrated? Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament of the Bible, the event is said to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in roughly 30 AD. Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities, essentially because he claimed to be the \u201cSon of God\u201d, and was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate. Jesus\u2019 death by crucifixion, marked by the Christian holiday Good Friday and subsequent resurrection three days later is said to have been done to prove that he was the living son of God. Easter also concludes the \u201cPassion of Christ\u201d - a series of events and holidays that begins with Lent. Lent is a 40-day fasting period which comes before Easter in the Christian and is a time for reflection in Christian traditions as well as for preparations before the celebration of Easter begins. Lent ends of Holy Thursday, which celebrates Jesus\u2019 Last Supper with his 12 apostles. The Easter holiday in the UK begin on Good Friday on which Jesus\u2019 crucifixion is observed and end on Easter Sunday. Easter is a moveable celebration so it can be hard to keep up to date on when it starts. Easter falls on the first Sunday after the Full Moon date, based on mathematical calculations, that falls on or after March 21. In 325 AD the Council of Nicaea ruled Easter would be held on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. However, if a the Full Moon falls on a Sunday, then Passover begins on a Sunday, so Easter is then delayed by a week to make sure it still occurs after Passover.

Dealing with Mealybugs\n\n**Symptoms and Description:**\n- **White, Fuzzy Things:** You are correct in suspecting mealybugs, which are small, white, cottony insects that typically appear on the undersides of leaves and along stems. They often have a waxy, protective covering that makes them appear fuzzy and can have small legs that they use for movement.\n  \n**Control Measures:**\n- **Physical Removal:** Using a damp cloth or cotton swabs dipped in rubbing alcohol, you can remove individual mealybugs from your plants. This method is effective for small infestations. Make sure to target both the insects and their eggs, which can be more difficult to see and remove.\n- **Insecticidal Soap or Neem Oil:** These are environmentally friendly and can be very effective for managing mealybug infestations. Follow the instructions on the product label for proper application and frequency.\n- **Monitoring:** Regularly check your plants for signs of mealybugs, as they can reappear if not thoroughly addressed. Early detection is key to managing any plant pest problem effectively.\n- **Pruning:** If the mealybug infestation is severe, you may need to prune affected parts of the plant to limit the spread.

It\u2019s in New York Magazine. \u201cEarlier this week, I went to a lecture given by Steven Pinker on his latest book, Enlightenment Now. I\u2019m a huge and longtime fan of Pinker\u2019s, and his book The Blank Slate was, for me, a revelation. [Pinker]\u2019s become a deep and important critic of the visceral hostility to nature and science now so sadly prevalent on the left and right, a defender of reason and the Enlightenment against the \u2018social justice\u2019 movements on campus, and his new book is a near-relentless defense of modernity. \u201cI sat there for an hour slowly being buried in a fast-accumulating snowdrift of irrefutable statistics showing [amazing] human progress: the decline of violence and war, the rise and rise of democracy, the astonishing gains against poverty of the last couple of decades, the rise of tolerance and erosion of cruelty, lengthening lifespans, revolutions in health, huge increases in safety, and on and on. It was one emphatic graph after another that bludgeoned my current depression into a kind of forced rational cheeriness.\u201d In other words, this guy Pinker had been accumulating data to show that \u2014 in a universal way all over the world \u2014 all of our problems are getting better. But how many of you when I said, \u201cThe decline of violence and war,\u201d responded, \u201cWait a minute! There is not any decline\u2026\u201d? That\u2019s your instinct reaction, because what\u2019s on your mind is in Parkland, and we\u2019ve been at war in Afghanistan for seemingly, what, 18 years? \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the war in the Middle East 18 years. What do you mean less war? What do you mean less violence?\u201d Well, statistically, worldwide war is happening much less \u2014 so is violence \u2014 according to the stats. But in your living experience, it\u2019s kind of contradictory because it doesn\u2019t seem so, but that\u2019s the point. After looking at the evidence of how much improvement in the areas of squalor of life, you kind of have to do a check and say, \u201cWait a minute.

It doesn\u2019t jibe with what I think I\u2019m seeing.\u201d Here\u2019s the last sentence of the paragraph: \u201cThere were no real trade-offs here; our gloom is largely self-imposed; and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d Bingo! Now, that may sound like deep stuff, but let me tell you what that means. What that means is we have forgotten the human flourishing, we\u2019ve forgotten the goodness, we have forgotten the happiness, the contentment that comes from a common idea of morality. My word in this case for virtue, and a concept of morality that is based our nature. These two paragraphs to me are dynamite. In the first place, \u201cour gloom is largely self-imposed and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d I could not agree more! That\u2019s why I have often suggested, if you want to change your life turn off news for a week and just see. Just do it. Turn off the news, do not watch any news. Do not watch any cable news anywhere for a week! You can do it. Don\u2019t be afraid. You can do it. You can listen to me because I do not make people feel unhappy or fill them with doom or gloom. Quite the opposite. This program lifts people up, makes people laugh. You know, we\u2019ve got this new thing we\u2019re doing at RushLimbaugh.com where we are actively responding to people.

It\u2019s a work in progress. But the things that we are learning, the questions people want to ask me are better than any I have been asked by anybody on TV, by far, both personal and professional. And they\u2019re a joy to deal with. I answered one of these questions on a video last week. I hope we\u2019re able to post it this week. I\u2019m making no guarantees \u2019cause it\u2019s a new project that we\u2019re just getting up and running.

And I would not have even thought to mention this today had it not been for this paragraph of Andrew Sullivan\u2019s. There\u2019s a common, almost everybody that we\u2019ve talked to \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of them now \u2014 are saying one variation or another that this program lets them know every day it\u2019s okay, that things are okay.

The demographic spread is amazing. It\u2019s fabulous to learn and see those of you who are participating in our little program here. Well, it\u2019s actually gonna get very big.

It can destroy a good mood. It can destroy contentment. And it shouldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s what it does. And if you turn it off for a week, you will see exactly what I\u2019m talking about.

We don\u2019t make you feel like everything\u2019s doom and gloom and the end is near or anything like that at all. Quite the opposite. And then the admission here that we\u2019ve lost a common virtue, we\u2019ve lost a common morality, we\u2019ve lost a common base that unites us, that binds us together. The world is better than ever. Why are we so miserable? Social media plays a role in this too. But I don\u2019t know that social media is the cause of it.

If you think Trump vanished tomorrow that The hate would stop? No way. Their hate is never going to end. That\u2019s the point.

Andrew Sullivan, a conservative blogger, highlights Steven Pinker's lecture, emphasizing how statistics can often contradict personal and immediate experiences. This is particularly salient in the context of the modern world, where there's a clear dichotomy between the objective data that shows a significant improvement in human quality of life, and the pervasive narrative of decline and strife.\n\nSullivan's commentary touches on several key points:\n\n1. **Self-Imposed Gloom**: He suggests that much of the gloom and negativity in today\u2019s discourse is largely self-imposed, driven by the focus on negative news and social issues. The media often amplifies the worst aspects of reality, which fosters a sense of despair and dissatisfaction, contrary to the overall trend of progress and improvement in global conditions.\n\n2. **Media Influence**: Sullivan posits that the media diet we consume can significantly influence our perception of the world, often skewing it towards the more negative or dramatic aspects, even when the statistics suggest otherwise. He advocates for a break from the daily news cycle, emphasizing that disconnecting from the negative narratives for a week can provide a positive perspective shift.\n\n3. **Lack of Common Virtue and Morality**: There\u2019s a broader critique about the erosion of a commonly shared moral or virtuous framework that once united people.

This involves not just believing in Jesus, but also following his example and teachings in daily life.\n  \n2. **Sacred Ground (Sanctuary)**: Churches are seen as sacred places, often referred to as the \"holy ground.\" They symbolize a place where God's presence is near and where community is formed and supported.\n\n3. **Inclusivity and Love**: The Episcopal Church values inclusivity and welcomes all seekers, regardless of background or circumstances. Embracing all people is seen as a reflection of God\u2019s boundless love.\n\n4. **Liberation Ministry**: Episcopalians strive to be agents of liberation, supporting justice and equality for all.

Yemen is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis, and the country\u2019s children are bearing the brunt of the tragedy. Nearly 1.5 million children there are acutely malnourished, according to international aid organizations. Save the Children estimated that a third of all children under five in Yemen fall into this category. Of those, about 370,000 are said to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition \u2014 it means they are 10 times more likely to die than malnourished children because their immune system has been dramatically weakened. As that figure continues to rise, images like this are emerging from the country, where a civil war broke out last year. Despite some international attention, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The conflict has pushed the country to the brink of famine; in many remote villages, mothers themselves are too malnourished to feed their children. Majed Ayyash, a 21-month-old child who suffered from severe malnutrition, is one of the fortunate ones in the country's capital, Sanaa, because his family managed to get him to a hospital. But even when families manage to get their children medical help, the remaining doctors and nurses are forced to work with limited supplies and almost no equipment. A number of medical facilities in the country have been frequently targeted by airstrikes.

A full-blown civil war began in February last year after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee Sanaa. Since then, the Houthis have continuously clashed with Hadi, who is supported by local militia and tribespeople in the predominantly Sunni south of the country. Hadi says the Houthis are proxies for Iran, an allegation that Iran has denied. As a result, the Saudi-led coalition that has offered its support to Hadi has been engaged in airstrikes that have claimed thousands of lives, many of them civilians. Yemen, which imports 90% of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world before the outbreak of war, according to the Associated Press. Nearly 18 months into a Saudi-led blockade, the situation has become worse. This is 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod. He had acute malnutrition because his family was unable to afford food for him. Since the beginning of the war last year, the average cost of a food basket has gone up by 26%. Since April, the price has increased by 13%, according to a World Food Program Market Watch report in July. The situation has become so dire that according to Doctors Without Borders, it had to increase its staff's wages by up to 50% in some regions just so they could continue to buy food. In March, 10 out of 22 governorates in Yemen were considered on the brink of famine. Now, all but two are, according to a recent BBC report.

THE hard times made it all the sweeter for Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon as he celebrated his 13th grand slam title. The Serbian defeated Kevin Anderson 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7/3) to win his fourth Wimbledon crown, but first grand slam title since the French Open in 2016, which proved to be a dramatic turning point in his career. Novak Djokovic, right, is congratulated by Kevin Anderson after the men's singles final (Picture: John Walton/PA Wire). From holding all four slam titles Djokovic lost motivation, form and confidence before being forced to take six months off at the end of last season when elbow problems struck. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk now and look back at it and be kind of grateful, but I really am grateful to go through these kind of mixed emotions, turbulence, as well mentally, moments of doubt and disappointment and frustration, anger. Djokovic returned to the tour at the Australian Open in January, but his elbow was still hurting and in February he was forced to accept he needed to undergo surgery. Coming back in Indian Wells only a few weeks later proved a mistake with Djokovic a shadow of the player and competitor who dominated the tour for long spells between 2011 and 2016. But, after splitting from coach Andre Agassi and reuniting with mentor Marian Vajda, Djokovic gradually began to look more like his old self. There were signs on clay, but it was not until this tournament, and especially in his epic semi-final victory over Rafael Nadal, that there became no doubt the real Djokovic was back. He said, after taking a now-trademark taste of Wimbledon\u2019s grass: \u201cI couldn\u2019t pick a better place in the tennis world to peak and to make a comeback. Wimbledon has been always a very special tournament to me. I dreamed of winning it when I was a seven-year-old boy. I made a lot of improvised Wimbledon trophies from different materials. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to compare this year\u2019s victory and trophy with any of the other three because they\u2019re all special. Wimbledon do not allow children under five to watch matches in Centre Court, but three-year-old Stefan was brought into Djokovic\u2019s box for the trophy ceremony and shouted excitedly as his father walked over to do a BBC interview. Anderson was playing in his second slam final in less than a year after losing to Rafael Nadal at the US Open last summer. The 32-year-old South African, a late bloomer as a grand slam challenger, is learning the same lesson as many of his contemporaries: if one of the big fish does not get you, another one probably will. Of the last 46 slams, all but eight have been won by Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer. A career-best victory over Federer in the quarter-finals followed by an epic semi-final against John Isner kept Anderson on court for nearly 11 hours so it was no surprise that he was not as his best to start with. But he made a real fight of it in the third set where he held five set points. Anderson, who will rise to a career-high of No 5 in the world rankings, said: \u201cIt was a tough start for me. You always have high hopes. \u201cI was hoping to draw on some previous experiences, playing at the US Open in the final, obviously playing Federer a couple days ago. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really find my form the way I wanted to. Of course, my body didn\u2019t feel great, but I was definitely quite nervous starting out the match. I tried my best to keep at it. \u201cI definitely felt much better in the third set. I thought I had quite a few opportunities to win that third set. Barry Davies said it had \u201cbeen a lot of fun\u201d as he brought his commentary career to an end at Wimbledon. The 80-year-old called the mixed doubles final featuring Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka before leaving the BBC\u2019s Centre Court booth for the last time. Davies worked at ITV before joining the BBC in 1969 and his voice became one of the most distinctive in sport. Davies covered a host of World Cups and Olympic Games while also being a lead commentator for many years at Wimbledon. He was joined by Australian Liz Smylie on his final job and, after the mixed doubles reached its conclusion and the trophy presentations had taken place, he offered his farewell. \u201cWe will miss you Barry,\u201d said Smylie, a former Wimbledon doubles champion. \u201cI will miss you too,\u201d said Davies. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger.

He said, after taking a now-trademark taste of Wimbledon\u2019s grass: \u201cI couldn\u2019t pick a better place in the tennis world to peak and to make a comeback. Wimbledon has been always a very special tournament to me. I dreamed of winning it when I was a seven-year-old boy. I made a lot of improvised Wimbledon trophies from different materials. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to compare this year\u2019s victory and trophy with any of the other three because they\u2019re all special. Wimbledon do not allow children under five to watch matches in Centre Court, but three-year-old Stefan was brought into Djokovic\u2019s box for the trophy ceremony and shouted excitedly as his father walked over to do a BBC interview. Anderson was playing in his second slam final in less than a year after losing to Rafael Nadal at the US Open last summer. The 32-year-old South African, a late bloomer as a grand slam challenger, is learning the same lesson as many of his contemporaries: if one of the big fish does not get you, another one probably will. Of the last 46 slams, all but eight have been won by Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer. A career-best victory over Federer in the quarter-finals followed by an epic semi-final against John Isner kept Anderson on court for nearly 11 hours so it was no surprise that he was not as his best to start with. But he made a real fight of it in the third set where he held five set points. Anderson, who will rise to a career-high of No 5 in the world rankings, said: \u201cIt was a tough start for me. You always have high hopes. \u201cI was hoping to draw on some previous experiences, playing at the US Open in the final, obviously playing Federer a couple days ago. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really find my form the way I wanted to. Of course, my body didn\u2019t feel great, but I was definitely quite nervous starting out the match. I tried my best to keep at it. \u201cI definitely felt much better in the third set. I thought I had quite a few opportunities to win that third set. Barry Davies said it had \u201cbeen a lot of fun\u201d as he brought his commentary career to an end at Wimbledon. The 80-year-old called the mixed doubles final featuring Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka before leaving the BBC\u2019s Centre Court booth for the last time. Davies worked at ITV before joining the BBC in 1969 and his voice became one of the most distinctive in sport. Davies covered a host of World Cups and Olympic Games while also being a lead commentator for many years at Wimbledon. He was joined by Australian Liz Smylie on his final job and, after the mixed doubles reached its conclusion and the trophy presentations had taken place, he offered his farewell. \u201cWe will miss you Barry,\u201d said Smylie, a former Wimbledon doubles champion. \u201cI will miss you too,\u201d said Davies. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger. Come back and visit,\u201d Smylie responded.", "generated_text": "The passage describes Novak Djokovic's triumphant return to the pinnacle of his career at Wimbledon, where he secured his 13th Grand Slam title.

He emphasized Wimbledon\u2019s importance since it had been a special tournament to him since childhood.\n\n5. **Family Moments**: During the celebration, three-year-old Stefan, Djokovic's son", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.0022213997860536, "p": 0.001340085864034224, "detected_greenlist_number": 176, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.760382354259491, "Recall": 0.7739014029502869, "Accuracy": 0.7664999961853027}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.760382354259491, "Recall": 0.7739014029502869, "Accuracy": 0.7664999961853027}, "total_statistics": [2307.0, 2292.0, 727.0, 674.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2307.0, 2292.0, 727.0, 674.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 73}

During a search for the vehicles, the officer pulled into a parking lot for an apartment building in the 4000 block of 115th Street in Chicago and found two people inside the Cadillac. The officer used his marked squad car, with its light activated, to block the Cadillac into the parking lot, prosecutors said. He and his partner then got out of the squad car and told Campbell and his passenger to raise their hands. Campbell then put the Cadillac into reverse, backed up slightly, and then accelerated forward toward the officer, prosecutors said. The officer stepped back and fired a shot at Campbell in an attempt to stop the Cadillac. Campbell \u201cbegan making multiple movements within the vehicle\u201d and the officer fired a second shot, which incapacitated him, according to court records. Campbell was shot twice in the shoulder and was given medical attention by the Alsip officers before paramedics arrived, authorities. He was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in serious condition. Prosecutors said the incident was captured on the squad car\u2019s camera and on surveillance video from the apartment complex. Both officers suffered \u201cminor injuries\u201d and were taken to a hospital as a precaution, Alsip police and Chicago police said. Chicago police investigated the shooting and crash. Illinois State Police were asked to investigate the Alsip officer\u2019s use of force to \u201cavoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest,\u201d according to Miller. Neither officer has been involved in a shooting before and both have \u201cgood records\u201d with the department. No Chicago police officers were involved in the shooting, authorities said.

In an article by NoCamels, KidsCash\u2019s founders said the program is meant to give kids a little autonomy with a small amount of money, allowing them to make some purchases themselves \u2013 without their parents credit cards or prepaid cards \u2013 and teaching them the fundamentals of growing, saving, and donating their money. Parents can control how much they supervise the money \u2013 including options such as approving purchases through SMS or email, or just letting their children get automatic approval within a certain monetary limit. Parents can also determine what percentage can be spent on which types of items, and receive alerts if their children have spent over a certain amount in one day. The items for sale are all within the control of the KidsCash marketplace, and include iTunes and other gaming products, as well as links to other approved sites, according to the NoCamels report.

NEWTOWN -- Greenridge residents, raise your glasses. Newtown has agreed to share its water with you. The Legislative Council on Wednesday evening authorized First Selectman Pat Llodra to sign a contract allowing a 12-inch water line to run from Newtown along Route 25 to Greenridge, a district of 229 homes in Brookfield. Last week, Brookfield authorized Bill Davidson, its first selectman, to sign the contract. Greenridge's water is contaminated with radiation particles called radionuclides, which are possible carcinogens, said James Rice, the attorney representing Newtown in the matter. Radionuclides includes uranium, radon, and radium, said Marty Handshy, a water consultant for Brookfield's Board of Selectmen. The contract says United Water Co. will not serve Brookfield customers outside of the Greenridge area for three years. The water main will also serve residents of the borough section of Newtown, Rice said. About three years ago, the state approved United Water Co. extending a water line to the Greenridge area, Davidson said last week. The water company planned to do so by diverting water from the Pootatuck aquifer, Newtown's sole water source, Llodra said. She added that her reaction was \"How dare they think they can come to Newtown and take our water?\" Newtown was not invited to participate in the initial discussions between the state and United Water Co., Llodra said. Eventually she and other town officials and lawyers representing the town halted the process until an agreement could be reached, she said. United Water began construction of the water line May 25, 2010, according to the contract, and on June 1, 2010, the Department of Public Utility Control Commissioner ordered that construction cease. The town of Newtown, the borough section of Newtown and the town of Brookfield intervened to protect the interests of their respective citizens, and, in Newtown's case, the Pootatuck Aquifer, the contract says. The town of Newtown has been negotiating with United Water Co. and Brookfield for about seven months now to add stipulations to construction of the line, Llodra said. Rice said if the towns had not reached an agreement, United Water would have flowed the water line without any restrictions, and Newtown would have had to appeal in state Superior Court. Some of Llodra's concerns were that there was no diversion process executed and it was not clear what effect the water line would have on Newtown wells and the Pootatuck Aquifer, she said. The agreement allows United Water to construct the water line project named Newtown Greenridge Interconnection Improvements. However, for three years the line may not serve Brookfield customers living outside the Greenridge area unless there is an emergency, according to the contract. To expand its service area after that time, the company must conduct a study of the Pootatuck Aquifer and Pootatuck River and/or other potential sources of water to show that it Newtown water sources would not be harmed. The study will assist water utility planning in compliance with current and future regulations of the state, and will be used in discussions with Newtown and Brookfield, the contract says. The study could take up to 18 months and United Water will decide when it starts, the contract says. Handshy said the state Department of Public Utility Control in New Britain will rule on the agreement in the near future.

Spreadsheets were originally designed to handle basic data manipulation, financial analysis, and simple calculations. However, their versatility and ease of use have led businesses to increasingly rely on them for more complex tasks, including data integration, process automation, and even some forms of data analysis and visualization.\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to this disconnect and the issues that arise from it:\n\n1. **Complexity and Scope**: Spreadsheets are powerful tools, but they lack the robust features and controls found in modern data management systems. For instance, they lack proper data validation, version control, and auditing features, which can lead to errors, mismanagement of large datasets, and difficulty in tracking changes.\n\n2. **Data Integrity and Security**: Spreadsheets often store sensitive business information and can be prone to accidental or intentional data breaches. Limited access control features make it difficult to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify data, and the ease of sharing spreadsheets via email or cloud storage platforms can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scalability Issues**: As businesses grow and the volume of data they need to manage increases, spreadsheets can become unwieldy and inefficient.

The competitive spirit and physical conflicts between the different Christian denominations sharing the space highlight some of the challenges in inter-faith cooperation and the management of contentious shared heritage sites globally.\n\nThe idea of organizing a Rugby Union match to channel this energy and prevent future conflicts is both humorous and practical. Rugby, with its emphasis on teamwork, strategy, and respect between opponents, offers a structured and non-violent arena for competition. However, introducing a sport like rugby into such a setting would likely require significant negotiations and planning, especially to establish clear boundaries and ensure safety for all participants.\n\nMoreover, such an initiative could potentially serve as an example of how differing communities can coexist and even engage in positive activities together, fostering mutual understanding and respect. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre could become not just a site of religious devotion but also a beacon of inter-communal harmony and cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the current situation is chaotic and fraught with tension, initiatives aimed at promoting peaceful and constructive engagement could be a step towards more harmonious coexistence at this historically significant location. The rugby suggestion, though lighthearted, embodies a spirit of resolution and community building, which is ultimately what is needed to overcome longstanding conflicts and disagreements.

BRUSSELS \u2014 Within minutes of a bomb blast at Brussels\u2019 main airport, mobile phone and internet networks crashed. After a second attack struck a metro station in Maelbeek, which feeds the main European Union complex, Belgian soldiers, who have been a regular presence in the city center since last November\u2019s bloody attacks in Paris, departed, apparently to join the first responders at both scenes. At the Central Police Station, located a few hundred meters from the Gran Place, in the very center of Brussels, dozens of off-duty police both in uniform and plainclothes could be seen reporting for emergency duty, many carrying automatic weapons. A squad of Belgian army members known as para-commandos also deployed and began patrolling various areas in the city center in full combat gear. Tuesday\u2019s attack came after a week of tensions throughout the Belgian capital as security forces closed in on Salah Abdeslam, believed by French and Belgian investigators to be the last surviving member of the ISIS cell that carried out the Paris attacks that killed more than 130 people and wounded hundreds more in a multi-pronged attack on the French capital last year. A raid in Brussels' Forrest neighborhood last Tuesday killed an Algerian with suspected ISIS ties, but Abdeslam was believed to have escaped back to his childhood haunt of Molenbeek, a largely Muslim immigrant neighborhood just outside central Brussels. Using a combination of electronic tracking of mobile phones and what investigators say was human intelligence, according to local media reports and terror analysts, security forces cornered, wounded, and arrested Abdesalm last Friday. Belgian authorities said early Tuesday afternoon that a massive manhunt was underway in Brussels for individuals they believe were linked to Tuesday's attacks. Belgian counterterrorism officials have been on high alert for years as hundreds of citizens and residents have departed for the battlefields of Syria and Iraq. One Belgian official said that besides the names of hundreds of fighters believed to be abroad, the security services have more than 200 open files related to threats at home and in Europe. But they remain flooded with questions about how and why they missed a key member of the Paris attacks for more than four months, and will have to explain how just four days after his arrest, the country was devastated by a double attack on both the international airport and a metro station that feeds Europe\u2019s central government, hardly areas considered soft or easy targets. One Belgian counterterrorism official told BuzzFeed News last week that due to the small size of the Belgian government and the huge numbers of open investigations \u2014 into Belgian citizens suspected of either joining ISIS, being part of radical groups in Belgium, and the ongoing investigations into last November\u2019s attacks in Paris, which appeared to be at least partially planned in Brussels and saw the participation of several Belgian citizens and residents \u2014 virtually every police detective and military intelligence officer in the country was focused on international jihadi investigations. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the people to watch anything else and, frankly, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to properly investigate or monitor hundreds of individuals suspected of terror links, as well as pursue the hundreds of open files and investigations we have,\u201d the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said. The streets of Brussels were relatively calm by Tuesday afternoon. Some foreign tour groups continued to visit sites in the city\u2019s historic district. But one Belgian who gave his name as Andre, a 42-year-old telecommunications and marketing executive for the Belgian telecom firm Mobistar, said that the historical government divisions between the southern French speaking and northern Dutch speakers that have often left Belgium\u2019s government fractured and ineffective were largely responsible for the country\u2019s inability to prevent the sort of terror attacks that struck on Tuesday. \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t have a real government and a divided bureaucracy,\u201d he said.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "raw_prompt": "\u201cIt\u2019s literally an impossible situation,\u201d one counterterrorism official told BuzzFeed News.

After a second attack struck a metro station in Maelbeek, which feeds the main European Union complex, Belgian soldiers, who have been a regular presence in the city center since last November\u2019s bloody attacks in Paris, departed, apparently to join the first responders at both scenes. At the Central Police Station, located a few hundred meters from the Gran Place, in the very center of Brussels, dozens of off-duty police both in uniform and plainclothes could be seen reporting for emergency duty, many carrying automatic weapons. A squad of Belgian army members known as para-commandos also deployed and began patrolling various areas in the city center in full combat gear. Tuesday\u2019s attack came after a week of tensions throughout the Belgian capital as security forces closed in on Salah Abdeslam, believed by French and Belgian investigators to be the last surviving member of the ISIS cell that carried out the Paris attacks that killed more than 130 people and wounded hundreds more in a multi-pronged attack on the French capital last year. A raid in Brussels' Forrest neighborhood last Tuesday killed an Algerian with suspected ISIS ties, but Abdeslam was believed to have escaped back to his childhood haunt of Molenbeek, a largely Muslim immigrant neighborhood just outside central Brussels. Using a combination of electronic tracking of mobile phones and what investigators say was human intelligence, according to local media reports and terror analysts, security forces cornered, wounded, and arrested Abdesalm last Friday. Belgian authorities said early Tuesday afternoon that a massive manhunt was underway in Brussels for individuals they believe were linked to Tuesday's attacks. Belgian counterterrorism officials have been on high alert for years as hundreds of citizens and residents have departed for the battlefields of Syria and Iraq. One Belgian official said that besides the names of hundreds of fighters believed to be abroad, the security services have more than 200 open files related to threats at home and in Europe. But they remain flooded with questions about how and why they missed a key member of the Paris attacks for more than four months, and will have to explain how just four days after his arrest, the country was devastated by a double attack on both the international airport and a metro station that feeds Europe\u2019s central government, hardly areas considered soft or easy targets. One Belgian counterterrorism official told BuzzFeed News last week that due to the small size of the Belgian government and the huge numbers of open investigations \u2014 into Belgian citizens suspected of either joining ISIS, being part of radical groups in Belgium, and the ongoing investigations into last November\u2019s attacks in Paris, which appeared to be at least partially planned in Brussels and saw the participation of several Belgian citizens and residents \u2014 virtually every police detective and military intelligence officer in the country was focused on international jihadi investigations. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the people to watch anything else and, frankly, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to properly investigate or monitor hundreds of individuals suspected of terror links, as well as pursue the hundreds of open files and investigations we have,\u201d the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said. The streets of Brussels were relatively calm by Tuesday afternoon. Some foreign tour groups continued to visit sites in the city\u2019s historic district. But one Belgian who gave his name as Andre, a 42-year-old telecommunications and marketing executive for the Belgian telecom firm Mobistar, said that the historical government divisions between the southern French speaking and northern Dutch speakers that have often left Belgium\u2019s government fractured and ineffective were largely responsible for the country\u2019s inability to prevent the sort of terror attacks that struck on Tuesday. \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t have a real government and a divided bureaucracy,\u201d he said.", "generated_text": "The passage describes a tense and chaotic situation in Brussels following a coordinated terrorist attack that targeted the city's main airport and a metro station. The context and events leading to the attack provide several key points of interest and insights into the broader challenges faced by European nations in counterterrorism:\n\n1. **Pre-attack Clue and Warnings:**\n   - Salah Abdeslam, a suspected key member of the ISIS cell responsible for the Paris attacks in 2015, was reportedly identified by Belgian and French investigators after the previous week's raid in the Brussels area. This led to apprehending or wounding Abdeslam.\n\n2. **Security Presence:**\n   - Belgian security forces, including soldiers and paramilitary units, were in heightened alert positions around key areas, including Brussels' central and high-profile locations, like the European Union complex and major transit hubs. However, the presence of security personnel did not prevent the attacks.\n\n3. **Infrastructure Failure During Attacks:**\n   - Mobile phone and internet networks malfunctioned shortly after the initial explosion at the airport, which likely hindered emergency coordination and communication during the attacks and their aftermath.\n\n4. **Resource Constraints:**\n   - Counterterrorism officials acknowledge the challenges associated with the overwhelming number of open investigations and a lack of resources to monitor and investigate all suspected threats effectively.\n\n5. **Historical and Structural Issues:**\n   - The passage mentions the linguistic and cultural divisions between the French-speaking south and the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium, which", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.04145188432738, "p": 2.6560640797090862e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 185, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7896482944488525, "Recall": 0.7896482944488525, "Accuracy": 0.7886666655540466}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7896482944488525, "Recall": 0.7896482944488525, "Accuracy": 0.7886666655540466}, "total_statistics": [2380.0, 2352.0, 634.0, 634.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2380.0, 2352.0, 634.0, 634.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 88}

According to Chris Boyd, a malware researcher at Sunbelt Software, there indeed was a reported issue on YouTube involving a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allowed malicious actors to manipulate video pages in a way that included blocking comments and adding scrollable text. However, it's crucial to distinguish between an actual attack and a situation where misleading information spread rapidly through the internet, causing alarm even where none was necessary.\n\nTo break it down further:\n\n1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**: This is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into content that is served to other users, like comments or ads on a website. In this case, the vulnerability could be exploited to manipulate video pages on YouTube, potentially with the malicious intent of blocking comments or adding scrollable text.\n\n2. **Misinformation and the Chinese Whispers Paradox**: The phrase \"Chinese Whispers\" alludes to a game where a message is passed from one person to another, often resulting in the message being changed in the process. In this context, it suggests that the panic and misinformation spread via the internet rapidly and inaccurately. Boyd highlighted that the real concern lies in the potential for a misinformative or intentionally misleading message to cause unnecessary alarm while genuine threats may not receive the attention they deserve due to the chaos caused by the misinformation.\n\n3. **Potential Mal", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.04145188432738, "p": 2.6560640797090862e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 185, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7936404943466187, "Recall": 0.8134353160858154, "Accuracy": 0.8004999756813049}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7936404943466187, "Recall": 0.8134353160858154, "Accuracy": 0.8004999756813049}, "total_statistics": [2446.0, 2357.0, 636.0, 561.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2446.0, 2357.0, 636.0, 561.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 89}

Ghost Recon Future Soldier is set to drop on May 22, and much of the buzz surrounding the new game has involved the Gunsmith system, whereby players can customize their own unique weapons. We had a chance to talk Gunsmith with Michael, as well as hear about what&apos;s in his personal gun collection. How many options are there for weapons customization in GRFS? There are 52 guns in the game, each with up to 10 points of customization. There are 20 million plus possible combinations that the user can choose from. What are some of the real weapons that have inspired you in developing GRFS? All the weapons in the game are either based on real firearms or inspired by real firearms. In the event we get our hands on the actual gun, we use that information about recoil impulses, muzzle climb, maneuverability, etc., and try to incorporate that into the weapon design in the game. What are some of the highlights of your personal collection? My personal favorite right now is a bolt action rifle that I just rebuilt from the ground up. It&apos;s nothing special, but knowing that I took the rifle from a pile of parts to a completed gun capable of shooting accurately 800 yards out is pretty gratifying. What&apos;s your favorite Ghost Recon Future Soldier feature? Call me biased, but I would have to say Gunsmith is my favorite feature. I love having the ability to customize my weapons according to my personal preferences and play style.

Ghost Recon Future Soldier is set to drop on May 22, and much of the buzz surrounding the new game has involved the Gunsmith system, whereby players can customize their own unique weapons. We had a chance to talk Gunsmith with Michael, as well as hear about what&apos;s in his personal gun collection. How many options are there for weapons customization in GRFS? There are 52 guns in the game, each with up to 10 points of customization. There are 20 million plus possible combinations that the user can choose from. What are some of the real weapons that have inspired you in developing GRFS? All the weapons in the game are either based on real firearms or inspired by real firearms. In the event we get our hands on the actual gun, we use that information about recoil impulses, muzzle climb, maneuverability, etc., and try to incorporate that into the weapon design in the game. What are some of the highlights of your personal collection? My personal favorite right now is a bolt action rifle that I just rebuilt from the ground up. It&apos;s nothing special, but knowing that I took the rifle from a pile of parts to a completed gun capable of shooting accurately 800 yards out is pretty gratifying.

This approach involved capturing, tagging, and releasing the mouse lemurs to gather accurate age-related data, which was then used to calculate the animals' longevity.\n\nKey findings from the study include:\n1. **Extended Lifespan**: Mouse lemurs can live at least eight years in the wild, a discovery that doubles previous estimates and underscores their resilience and longevity in natural habitats.\n2. **Dental Impressions as a Tool for Ageing**: The method of taking dental impressions from the lower right mandibular tooth rows of the mice lemurs provided a non-invasive and precise way to estimate age, offering a robust tool for future aging studies in small mammals.\n3. **No Gender Disparity in Testosterone Levels**: Contrary to expectations, the study found no significant difference in testosterone levels between male and female brown mouse lemurs, suggesting that environmental factors and hibernation practices might play a more crucial role in their longevity.\n4. **Hibernation's Impact on Longevity**: Given that mouse lemurs hibernate for half the year, the researchers propose that this seasonal adaptation could contribute to their increased lifespan", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.04145188432738, "p": 2.6560640797090862e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 185, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7990033030509949, "Recall": 0.8040788769721985, "Accuracy": 0.8015000224113464}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.7990033030509949, "Recall": 0.8040788769721985, "Accuracy": 0.8015000224113464}, "total_statistics": [2405.0, 2404.0, 605.0, 586.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2405.0, 2404.0, 605.0, 586.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 96}

Massachusetts businesses, looking to cut their health care costs, are teaming up on a new initiative aimed at sharply cutting the number of people who seek care in hospital emergency rooms when they could be treated elsewhere. Employer groups representing thousands of businesses across the state said Wednesday that they plan to reduce avoidable emergency room visits by 20 percent over the next two years, saving $100 million. More than 40 percent of emergency room visits \u2014 or about 1 million a year \u2014 are thought to be avoidable, according to state data. Many of these patients show up at hospitals with minor infections, sore throats, skin rashes, allergies, and back pain. Such visits can add to wait times in emergency rooms and drive up costs. Hospitals are many times more expensive than doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care clinics, and retail clinics. Employers said they will tackle the issue by better educating their workers about the most appropriate places to get health care, and by designing insurance plans that discourage unnecessary trips to the emergency room. They have not yet detailed what these incentives might be, but the incentives could include lower out-of-pocket costs for visiting a primary-care doctor, higher costs for visiting a hospital \u2014 or both. The initiative represents the first time that so many Massachusetts employers have coalesced around a particular driver of health care spending. It has the support of 20 business groups including Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and Retailers Association of Massachusetts. Hospitals, insurers, and the state Health Policy Commission \u2014 which tracks health spending \u2014 also back the effort. Millions of Massachusetts residents get health insurance through work, with their employers paying a significant portion of those costs. Business owners frequently complain that rising health care costs hamper their ability to hire and grow. State officials and academics have long tracked the inappropriate use of emergency rooms. But Massachusetts has not made progress in curbing unnecessary emergency room visits in at least five years, according to the Health Policy Commission \u2014 even though the vast majority of state residents have health insurance, and many have access to new walk-in clinics and telehealth services that provide alternatives to hospital care. \u201cUnfortunately, for many individuals, the emergency department becomes their main source of primary care,\u201d said David Seltz, executive director of the Health Policy Commission. The Massachusetts College of Emergency Physicians supports the business community\u2019s effort, but objects to estimates that peg avoidable emergency room visits at more than 40 percent. The group prefers a much lower estimate \u2014 3.3 percent \u2014 which was calculated using a much narrower definition. Dr. Scott Weiner, president of the emergency physicians group, noted that it\u2019s much easier to call a visit \u201cavoidable\u201d after the fact. A patient who thinks he is suffering a heart attack may actually have severe heartburn, for example, but he wouldn\u2019t know that until he sees a physician, Weiner noted. Backers of the initiative said they will be careful not to make emergency room visits so expensive that they deter people from going to the hospital when they may be seriously ill.

Conditions that frequently prompt such visits include minor infections, sore throats, skin rashes, allergies, and back pain.\n\n3. **Insurance and Financial Incentives:**\n   - Employer groups are developing insurance plans with various financial incentives designed to discourage unnecessary ER visits. These could include:\n     - Lower out-of-pocket costs for primary care doctor visits.\n     - Higher out-of-pocket costs for ER visits.\n     - A combination of both strategies.\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - A significant aspect of this initiative is increasing awareness among employees about the most appropriate settings for different types of medical care.
