Scientists are perfecting techniques for rebuilding tattered wetlands, creating custom configurations for individual shorelines. Governments and disaster planners are starting to give more consideration to living shorelines, and money to restore them is rising. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes. After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty. What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases. Gittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea. In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break. In recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine\u2019s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of \u201cgreen\u201d coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses. Around the time that Hurricane Irene was barreling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. \u201cA lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,\u201d Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and mangroves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory. The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012. Working with Risk Management Solutions, a leading risk-modeling firm, the scientists showed that wetlands prevented $625 million of flood damage from the storm, which was surprising given that the coasts in the region had already lost 60 to 90 percent of their protective wetlands over time. In areas that flooded, the few remaining wetlands lowered flood damage by 11 percent on average. As important was the ability to buffer garden-variety floods: in one local study, properties behind marshes suffered 16 percent less annual flood damage than properties that had lost their marshes. \u201cThat\u2019s well within the range for which you could expect [insurance] premium reductions,\u201d Beck points out. He and his partners then turned their economic and risk-management models on the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, which is regularly battered by big storms. They did an exhaustive analysis of the annual expected benefits and costs of all types of infrastructure. The team estimated that the coast would suffer $134 billion of losses over 20 years if no preventive measures were taken. Elevating homes could prevent $39.4 billion of those losses, but it is incredibly expensive. At an average of $83,300 per house, it would cost $54 billion to prevent that $39 billion in damages. The six-meter-high dikes being built in Louisiana were a worse option; at $33,000 per meter, they were an absurdly expensive way to protect a relatively limited amount of property, returning just $1 in savings for every $4 of expense. Smaller levees built on land in front of many low-lying coastal communities prevented much more damage for almost the same cost. In terms of bang for the buck, sandbags were the best investment, saving $8.4 billion of damages for a mere $0.84 billion in expense. Natural defenses ranked high as well. Wetlands restoration, which could prevent $18.2 billion of losses, would cost just $2 billion. Oyster-reef restoration could prevent $9.7 billion in losses for $1.3 billion. Barrier island restoration offered $5.9 billion of prevention for $1.2 billion. And \u201cbeach nourishment\u201d (replenishing depleted beaches with sand dredged from the seafloor) in the eastern Gulf could save $9.3 billion for $5.5 billion. Overall, the research found that $57.4 of the $134 billion could be prevented cost-effectively, almost all of it through green infrastructure. Cost-effective restoration may be tricky on long, sandy coasts, too. Beaches and barrier islands are by nature transient. Planting grasses to rebuild dunes can help keep beaches in place but only temporarily in many cases. At some point, residents will have to move back from the receding shoreline. One reason living shorelines are becoming an economically viable approach for coastal defense is that researchers and municipalities are getting better at rebuilding them. Early marsh-restoration designs, which followed forestry science and gave each plant plenty of space to avoid competition, were actually counterproductive. It turns out that in bare mudflats, \u201cwhen marsh plants are together, they share oxygen, so their growth rate is twice as high,\u201d says Brian Silliman, an ecologist at Duke University. Root them in large clumps, and the growth rate of each individual plant can triple. Add blue crabs, which eat the snails that eat the salt-marsh grasses, and the plants do even better. Scientists are also finding that marshes do best when they have a protective sill\u2014a linear berm that fronts the seaside edge of the grass and stands. Made of hard material such as shell, stone or concrete, its height and position are typically chosen so that water covers it at high tide, but it is exposed during low tide. The sill takes the brunt of wave energy but also traps sediment behind it, allowing the grass to thrive and marsh floor to retain its elevation or even rise. Almost any hard material can make a successful sill. Large shoreline-stabilization projects use big boulders or stackable concrete blocks, a practice that has been criticized by some experts who say that these structures are living shorelines in name only. But many lower-profile restorations integrate sills more seamlessly into the natural habitat. In the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions, marshes historically possessed a natural sill in the form of an intertidal oyster reef. Many of those reefs were overharvested long ago, ruining the sill and exposing the marshes to erosion. In these warm, oyster-friendly waters, new sills can be formed by placing a hard substrate along the low-tide line at the front edge of the marsh for baby oysters to set on. Some sites with lots of wave action have used small, hollow concrete structures or plastic mesh \u201conion bags\u201d stuffed with shell and lashed together. When successful, these artificial materials are quickly covered by oysters and disappear into the interstices of the growing reef. But the concrete often remains visible for years, and the bags have been criticized for breaking and scattering plastic through the environment. Gittman and Beck both stress the need to tailor living shorelines to local conditions. One reason oyster restoration is so cost-effective in the Gulf and the Southeast is because there have been plentiful wild oysters to seed new reefs with babies. That is not the case in most of the country. Chesapeake Bay, for example, was long the poster child for futile oyster restoration. Oyster populations in the bay had fallen to less than 1 percent of historical norms, and decades of effort and tens of millions of dollars barely budged the needle. Beck extends that lesson to coral reefs, the most underappreciated of natural defenses. \u201cCoral reefs are the single most effective ecosystem for flood-risk reduction,\u201d he says. Corals, which have evolved to take a daily pounding that would destroy most other living things, form natural seawalls exactly where you want them\u2014just offshore, in front of resorts, beach towns, coastal roads and other pricey assets. When healthy, they make remarkably effective breakwaters, reducing wave energy up to 97 percent. They are also affordable: reef restoration averages about $1,300 per meter versus $20,000 for artificial breakwater construction. The insurance industry\u2019s assessment for mitigating risk from climate change in the Caribbean found that reviving reefs and mangroves was an order of magnitude more cost-effective than seawalls or breakwaters. Even though reefs do not line a lot of shorefronts, the annual expected benefits they generate are significant\u2014more than $100 million a year in the U.S. alone and more than $400 million a year each in Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cuba. Coastal restoration may finally be getting the attention it deserves. \u201cThings are really beginning to change,\u201d Beck says. The Army Corps, which for decades has favored hardscape solutions, has launched an Engineering With Nature initiative\u2014something many planners thought they would never see. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made living shorelines a centerpiece of its coastal-resilience blueprint. Hundreds of projects have been completed or are underway around the country, ranging from shoreline stabilizations in Maryland to bulkhead removal in Puget Sound. Most are small, community-based efforts, but larger ventures are becoming more common. Stimulus funding that flowed after the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased the size of some projects significantly. Kilometers of oyster-reef projects now line Alabama, Texas and Louisiana. The flagship is Coffee Island, off the Alabama coast. The shoreline had receded up to 100 meters. The Nature Conservancy placed a three-kilometer-long line of shell bags and concrete balls about 30 meters offshore, paralleling the island. The reef immediately blocked wave energy, allowing the marsh to rebuild. Within two years approximately 200 baby oysters per square meter had colonized the structure, covering it and attracting fish, crabs and birds. Yet where there is a will\u2014and local money\u2014there is a way. The San Francisco Bay Clean Water, Pollution Prevention, and Habitat Restoration Measure, passed by Bay Area voters in 2016, raises $25 million a year for 20 years through a parcel tax. That $500 million will be used to build 40,000 hectares of wetlands\u2014the largest shoreline restoration undertaken in the U.S.\u2014using various techniques. The most novel is horizontal levees. Instead of a high, narrow mound that lines the shore, horizontal levees are broad mudflats, marshes and grasslands that gradually rise from the water\u2019s edge, sometimes for hundreds of meters back onto the land. They are graded with vast amounts of earth (often repurposed from building projects) and planted with starter plugs. They can be lower and 40 percent less costly than a traditional levee because the breadth absorbs floodwater. The configuration also gives marsh communities space to retreat as seas rise. Another encouraging sign is the Living Shorelines Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Frank Pallone, whose New Jersey district was devastated by Superstorm Sandy. The bill would designate $20 million in grants a year to living-shoreline work. A Senate version was introduced by Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California. Their prospects in the current Congress were uncertain at press time, but their existence shows that living shorelines are gaining ground. North Carolina\u2019s Coastal Resources Commission recently approved a new process that will make it as easy to obtain a living-shoreline permit as that for a bulkhead. Maryland has an even stronger law in place, requiring a homeowner to prove why a bulkhead is needed instead of a natural shoreline. Other states may follow these leads. The most promising indication of all may be the 2018 agreement made by the Nature Conservancy, the reinsurance industry and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo to create a trust fund to protect the Mesoamerican Reef, off the coast of Canc\u00fan and Puerto Morelos. The deal will include the first insurance policy ever taken out on a natural ecosystem. If the reef is damaged by a storm, insurance funds are released to rebuild its natural capital. For living shorelines to become an important part of any long-term coastal defense plan, policy makers in government, insurance and development will have to start improving and installing them before bad storms hit\u2014and funding the next round of projects through postdisaster spending afterward. That requires good science and good economic numbers\u2014which now exist\u2014as well as good proof in the form of demonstration projects, which are increasingly common. The first significant examples of postdisaster spending on natural infrastructure could occur as FEMA and other agencies look to spend more than $100 billion in recovery funds from recent hurricanes. Although FEMA\u2019s traditional hazard-mitigation investments have focused on tactics such as buying out damaged coastal homes or elevating them, the agency has adjusted its new \u201cbenefit-cost analysis\u201d policy to favor investment in natural infrastructure. Beck expects this change in emphasis to result in federally funded projects of unprecedented scope in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. Other large-scale development may soon follow worldwide as governments, disaster-risk managers, businesses, banks and insurers look to mitigate their risk exposure as cost-effectively as possible. When that happens, it will mark a moment when society realizes nature is not a luxury. It is the future.

Marshes with and without Sills Protect Estuarine Shorelines from Erosion Better Than Bulkheads during a Category 1 Hurricane. Rachel K.

Scientists are perfecting techniques for rebuilding tattered wetlands, creating custom configurations for individual shorelines. Governments and disaster planners are starting to give more consideration to living shorelines, and money to restore them is rising. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes. After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty. What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases. Gittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea. In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break. In recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine\u2019s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of \u201cgreen\u201d coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses. Around the time that Hurricane Irene was barreling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. \u201cA lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,\u201d Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and mangroves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory. The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012.

NZRU high performance referee manager Lyndon Bray said Jackson\u2019s signing as a full-time professional referee would add depth and provide a new dimension to New Zealand\u2019s professional pool of rugby referees. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Glen Jackson has chosen refereeing as the next step in his professional rugby career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that professional players at Glen\u2019s level make the move into refereeing but his skills as a player can only enhance his ability as a referee.

The New Zealander, contracted with Saracens, has been granted special leave to develop his refereeing skills and will start officiating in the 2010 Heartland Championship after completing the NZRU Referee Academy Training program. This move could add depth to New Zealand's professional referee pool and utilize his existing rugby expertise as he develops into a full-time professional referee, with the support of Lyndon Bray, the NZRU high performance referee manager. Jackson has played at various levels for teams such as Bay of Plenty, the Chiefs, New Zealand Maori, and the New Zealand Barbarians while starting out in refereeing as an age-grade rugby official in Tauranga. His path into refereeing was influenced by being a part of the Saracens team, where he could learn from and benefit from the coaching staff. As New Zealand's rugby continues to grow and evolve, a skilled rugby player like Glen Jackson taking on the challenge of becoming a professional referee could significantly contribute to the game's advancement and increase interest in officiating. The transition is a result of recognizing that his existing rugby expertise could enhance his skills as a referee and demonstrate the opportunities available to him with the signing as a full-time professional referee in New Zealand's referee pool.

Tiger Woods has done it again. Woods is a Masters champion for the fifth time in his illustrious, storied career. After an 11-year drought, golf's most polarizing and popular figure has added another major to his dossier, outlasting a star-studded leaderboard on Sunday by posting a final round 2-under 70 to win the 2019 Masters. It's his first major win since the 2008 U.S. Open, 15th of his career and first at Augusta National since 2005. With five green jackets now in his Augusta locker, Woods is second all-time at the pristine course behind only Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Woods began the day T2 and in the final pairing for the first time since 2007, but he sat two strokes off leader Francesco Molinari, who had been steady all week. Molinari led throughout much of the day, in fact, until double-bogeys on No. 12 and No. 15 opened a small window for Tiger to pounce -- and pounce he did. Woods birdied the par-5 13th hole and par-5 15th for the third time this week, then birdied the par-3 16th with a near-hole-in-one. He walked up to No. 17 with a two-stroke lead on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, and when Koepka missed a birdie putt on 18 that would have put pressure on Woods, Tiger was able to clinch it with a bogey on the final hole. \"I was just trying to plod my way around the golf course all day, then all of a sudden I had the lead, and coming up 18, it was just trying to make a 5,\" said Woods. \"When I tapped the putt in, I don't know what I did, but I know I screamed. And then I was just looking for Joey. I shook the guys' hands and then found Joey, and it was a pretty big embrace. To have my kids there, it's come full circle. My dad was here in 1997 and now i'm the dad with two kids there.\" Woods becomes a five-time Masters winner on Sunday, which stands alone as the second-most in the sport's history ahead of Arnold Palmer. Only Jack Nicklaus, who won six, has more. The victory marks Woods' first at Augusta since 2005, when he capped an incredible decade of dominance at the event he also won in 1997, 2000 and 2001. \"It's overwhelming,\" said Woods of winning for a fifth time. \"I think just because of what has transpired, and last year i was just very lucky to be playing again. The previous dinner, the champions dinner, I was really struggling and missed a couple years of not playing this great tournament. To now be the champion, 22 years between wins is a long time. But it's just unreal for me to experience this. My mom was here, she was there in 97 as well. So I just couldn't be more happy and more excited and i'm kind of at a loss for words, really.\" Woods' fourth and final round was a roller coaster, much like the rest of the field. He began with consecutive pars before birdie-bogey-bogey on 3, 4 and 5. In his final four holes on the first nine, he tapped in two birdies to stay on pace with the leaders. His second nine was bookended by bogeys, but in between, he played the seven holes at 3-under, led by consecutive birdies on 15 and 16. Following the victory, Woods made an appearance in Butler Cabin to receive his fifth green jacket from 2018 champion Patrick Reed. Sliding on the jacket, a wry smile crept across his face.

They note how the footage from the \"50-date sell-out concert\" was canceled due to health concerns and that it seems like the producers are trying to sell merchandise by exploiting Jackson's posthumous image.\n\nHowever, the reviewer attempts to redeem Jackson's enduring legacy by emphasizing the \"gracious professionalism and energetic drive for perfection\" displayed by the artist during the rehearsals. They also highlight specific moments from his performance, such as his powerful rendition of \"I'll Be There\" and his dance moves, which demonstrate his exceptional talent and dedication to his craft.\n\nFurthermore, the reviewer contrasts the film's editing with the true story of Jackson's hard work, pointing out that during the documentary's production, the actual footage of the musician is carefully curated to avoid showing his exhaustion, tardiness, or potential substance abuse issues. This contrast emphasizes the contrast between the sanitized narrative presented in the documentary and the unflinching reality that exists in his private life.

Convenient, packed with amenities, but at a price that makes the luxury of location affordable. A 15-minute walk or a five-minute bus ride brings guests to Universal Orlando\u2019s two theme parks, plus the shopping and dining at CityWalk, with its cinema multiplex, Hollywood Drive-In mini-golf and the home of theatrical sensation Blue Man Group. The resort is also right next to new water park Volcano Bay. Walt Disney World is 11 miles (17km) along motorway I-4, and Orlando International Airport is a convenient 17 miles (27km). A complimentary shuttle takes guests to SeaWorld and Aquatica. Divided into three distinct sections, retro-themed Cabana Bay\u2019s funky detailing brings to mind the roadside motels of the 1950s and 60s. Delightfully kitschy touches add to the nostalgia, notably the antique cars parked out front. The resort is made up of four low-rise tower blocks with a mixture of interior and exterior access, and twin 12-storey towers, which include 20 two-bedroom/two bathroom suites and grandstand views over Volcano Bay. The lovable Minions from the film Despicable Me visit the resort on Fridays, which adds to the family fun. Easy access to the theme parks is the big draw, but the resort has much more to enjoy. The Cabana Courtyard section offers an enormous zero-entry pool with water slide and an interactive children\u2019s play area, while Lazy River Courtyard features a pool and blissful lazy river for tubing. A 10-lane bowling alley and Ace Arcade are ideal for the occasional rainy day or an evening in, and health-conscious visitors have access to state-of-the-art Jack LaLanne Fitness Studio. At parents\u2019 discretion, children can be given pre-arranged charging privileges on their room key. Bold orange, blue and green d\u00e9cor follows through on the throwback theme without feeling obtrusive or overwhelming. Standard rooms sleep four, family suites sleep six, and two-bedroom/two bathroom suites sleep up to eight. Suites feature two televisions (three in two-bedroom suites) and a well-equipped kitchenette. Split bathrooms in the standard rooms and a compartmentalised bathroom (toilet and sink in separate rooms to shower) in the Beachside/Bayside tower suites are supremely family-oriented, especially for those eager to take advantage of the early entry perk into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter sections of the theme parks. Dining is limited, but the caf\u00e9 style Bayliner Diner food court features full breakfasts or breakfast sandwiches, plus soups, salads, pizza, burgers and an international selection at lunch and dinner, including Brazilian beef, vegetarian Lo Mein and Roast Chicken, and it makes a welcome break from the higher-priced offerings at nearby CityWalk.

Convenient, packed with amenities, but at a price that makes the luxury of location affordable. A 15-minute walk or a five-minute bus ride brings guests to Universal Orlando\u2019s two theme parks, plus the shopping and dining at CityWalk, with its cinema multiplex, Hollywood Drive-In mini-golf and the home of theatrical sensation Blue Man Group. The resort is also right next to new water park Volcano Bay. Walt Disney World is 11 miles (17km) along motorway I-4, and Orlando International Airport is a convenient 17 miles (27km). A complimentary shuttle takes guests to SeaWorld and Aquatica. Divided into three distinct sections, retro-themed Cabana Bay\u2019s funky detailing brings to mind the roadside motels of the 1950s and 60s. Delightfully kitschy touches add to the nostalgia, notably the antique cars parked out front. The resort is made up of four low-rise tower blocks with a mixture of interior and exterior access, and twin 12-storey towers, which include 20 two-bedroom/two bathroom suites and grandstand views over Volcano Bay. The lovable Minions from the film Despicable Me visit the resort on Fridays, which adds to the family fun. Easy access to the theme parks is the big draw, but the resort has much more to enjoy. The Cabana Courtyard section offers an enormous zero-entry pool with water slide and an interactive children\u2019s play area, while Lazy River Courtyard features a pool and blissful lazy river for tubing. A 10-lane bowling alley and Ace Arcade are ideal for the occasional rainy day or an evening in, and health-conscious visitors have access to state-of-the-art Jack LaLanne Fitness Studio. At parents\u2019 discretion, children can be given pre-arranged charging privileges on their room key. Bold orange, blue and green d\u00e9cor follows through on the throwback theme without feeling obtrusive or overwhelming. Standard rooms sleep four, family suites sleep six, and two-bedroom/two bathroom suites sleep up to eight. Suites feature two televisions (three in two-bedroom suites) and a well-equipped kitchenette. Split bathrooms in the standard rooms and a compartmentalised bathroom (toilet and sink in separate rooms to shower) in the Beachside/Bayside tower suites are supremely family-oriented, especially for those eager to take advantage of the early entry perk into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter sections of the theme parks. Dining is limited, but the caf\u00e9 style Bayliner Diner food court features full breakfasts or breakfast sandwiches, plus soups, salads, pizza, burgers and an international selection at lunch and dinner, including Brazilian beef, vegetarian Lo Mein and Roast Chicken, and it makes a welcome break from the higher-priced offerings at nearby CityWalk.

Athletes of pro football accomplish feats that seem impossible to us mere mortals as we watch the games unfold from the comforts of our living rooms or tucked away in the stands. With so many unique entities inhabiting the football universe, it's hard to truly decipher who the truly transcendent players are. Oddly enough, sometimes we understand it best with what disappoints us, rather than what impresses us. On Monday there was that sense of foolish disappointment looking at the box score for Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt. Wait, he only tallied 101 rushing yards in Kansas City's 29-20 victory over the Redskins? No 50-yard runs or end-zone trips? We'd come to expect more, after all, from the player who took his first 47 career carries for 401 yards and scored six total touchdowns. It's in the moments when you realize that a workhorse-like 25-touch, 121 total-yardage game internally registers as a letdown that reality sets in. Hunt is in the middle of a truly special season. The NFL just witnessed a transcendent season from a rookie running back last season. Drafting Ezekiel Elliott with the fourth-overall pick, and the subsequent selection of Dak Prescott, changed the trajectory of the Dallas Cowboys. Elliott was a tone-setter for the 2016 Cowboys, an engine for their drive to the NFC's No. 1 seed while quickly becoming the story of the season. Through four games, it's not outrageous to suggest that Hunt, a third-round draft pick, is set to have an even better campaign. All running backs are products of their environment. No rusher can truly function without proper blocking and even great backs -- see Todd Gurley's 2016 -- can be foiled when planted in a poisonous offensive soil. The mark of a good back is being able to succeed in well-established conditions and getting the yards blocked for them. The great backs are the ones who create yards beyond just what they're given. Hunt has been the best back this season at creating on his own. Through the first four games, he's gained an average of 6.1 more yards after a defender closes within one yard of him (NFL average is 3.6), leading the NFL among running backs with more than 25 carries. For comparison's sake, Elliott in 2016 averaged 4.4 yards after defenders closed within a yard of him. He ranked third in that category among backs with more than 200 carries. Elliott is a special player in the open field, a threat to break tackles and take any run for six. So far, Hunt looks like Elliott's equal in that regard. In his first few games it was easy to say that Hunt's stats were boosted by big runs. Indeed, plays like the 69-yard run against the Chargers to close out a Week 3 contest did boost his overall statistical finish. However, what we saw out of Hunt against Washington was a more sustaining runner. While the massive highlight reel runs didn't come in waves, he consistently gained positive yardage, going down for a loss on only two carries. Hunt stacked steady run after steady run, before eventually breaking two 15-plus yard plays. Kareem Hunt's #NextGenStats rushing chart from tonight. These types of consistent, offense-sustaining brand of games are what will really solidify Hunt as one of the best backs in the NFL. We all love big plays and they often flip the field to differentiate winners and losers. However, in close games when the offense needs to build up drives as the clock runs, a performance such as Hunt's latest is exactly what an NFL team looks for. Hunt was that player Monday, and he improved as an individual runner as the game went on. While he averaged 3.0 yards after a defender closed within a yard during the first two quarters, he improved to a 3.4 average in the second half. True feature backs get better as the game goes on. One area where Hunt does appear to have an edge on Elliott is in the passing game. Hunt has made several big catches in the early portions of his rookie campaign, whereas Zeke was less of a factor with less than 40 catches back in 2016. Hunt averaged 3.5 air yards per target, a notably high rate for running backs. Slot receivers like Randall Cobb and Jarvis Landry sit at 5.9 and 5.6 on the season, for comparison. Of course, if Hunt is to sustain such a special pace and truly enjoy a rookie-of-the-year campaign on par with Elliott's 2016, he'll need two more accompanying notes. The first is what all running backs need, as mentioned earlier: a little help from his friends. Elliott's blending with the Cowboys fabled offensive line made for the ingredients to an ideal dish. Elliott averaged 0.6 yards before a defender closed within a yard of him, doubling the league average of 0.3. The Next Gen Stats help to quantify the dominance of Dallas' 2016 and also help show that their decline this year is dragging Elliott back to mere mortal levels of production. Through four games, the argument can be made that Hunt enjoys an even better cast of characters opening lanes for him. The rookie back averages a whopping 1.3 yards before a defender closes within a yard of him this season. He's making the plays on his own once he gets to the second-level, so there's nothing to take away from him, but the Chiefs system and his offensive line are plowing lanes for him to show his best work. Additionally, now that the spotlight is firmly on him, Hunt will need to show he can still excel even when defenders are keying in on him. Elliott thrived in epic fashion when put to this test last season. The Cowboys and Zeke saw a stacked box (eight-plus defenders) on 28.9 percent of his carries in 2016 but it carried little weight. Elliott averaged 4.7 yards per carry on those plays, the fourth-highest among backs with 200-plus rushes. Hunt has consistently drawn that extra attention this year, seeing a stacked box on 32.4 percent of his carries. Through the first month of the 2017 campaign, it's been no damper to his ability. Hunt averages 8.0 yards per carry when facing stacked boxes this year, second-highest among backs with 20-plus carries. However, it's worth noting that Washington gave him the most trouble thus far in his NFL career. The Redskins stacked the box on 38.1 percent of Hunt's carries and he averaged just 1.9 yards per carry on those plays. Again, if this is truly going to be an Elliott 2016-type season for Hunt, Hunt will need to produce closer to his previous level in this regard. The NFL is full of surprises, but it's hard to come up with a bigger shock than the dominance of Hunt through the quarter mark of the 2017 regular season. No matter your expectations, he's exceeded them. As taken aback as we all were when Elliott took the league by storm as a rookie, it's even more outrageous to see a player drafted 82 spots later the following year do the same. It's all the more impressive that through four games, it's not outlandish to assert that Hunt is doing what Elliott did, and just might outdo him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "Published: Oct. 3, 2017 at 01:41 a.m. Updated: Oct. 3, 2017 at 04:11 a.m. The NFL is full of undeniably special players.

However, it also points out that Hunt's consistent running was not just limited to one game, but rather a sustained effort throughout the entire game.\n\nThe article compares Hunt to Dallas Cowboys rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott, who had a breakout season last year, and notes that Hunt is doing the same thing this season.

We've gotten glimpses of Corey Stoll's Yellowjacket villain from Ant-Man in a poster that debuted in December and promo art that arrived in February, but we have never seen an official image of the costume as it will be seen in the movie, until now. Entertainment Weekly has debuted a new photo as part of their summer movie preview, which gives us our best look at Yellowjacket yet, as he prepares to throw a punch at a diminutive Ant-Man. You honestly have to squint and focus to see the tiny Marvel superhero, but trust us, he's there. As you can see in the photo below, Cross' Yellowjacket costume is armed with plasma cannons, which puts Ant-Man at quite a disadvantage, although, when Ant-Man shrinks, his strength increases, according to director Peyton Reed. \"Hank Pym's Ant-Man suit doesn't have a single weapon, whereas Yellowjacket is armed with plasma cannons. Ant-Man is very fast when he's small. Also, when he shrinks, he increases his density, so he's got increased strength.\" Paul Rudd also talked about how playing Scott Lang was a completely new experience for him, since he had to wear a motion capture suit. \"It was a new experience as far as the motion-capture-suit-ness of it. But none of it feels that different. Every part, I'm pretending to be somebody I'm not. It's all just a big lie!\" Peyton Reed also shot down some recent reports that Ant-Man has already went through reshoots. The director states that there will be some additional photography, but he chalked it up to \"minor stuff.\" \"I love turning on the computer in the morning and reading the things that I did the day before-that I didn't do! We are going to do a little bit of additional photography, but we have not done any yet. It's minor stuff.\" Take a look at Yellowjacket below, and let us know what you think of this villain's look.

Next to the supermarket, a squat building covered with wooden boards has a pile of animal skins mouldering outside. It may seem surprising, but this could be the site of a revolution in pet preservation. Inside Mac's Taxidermy, Mike Mculloch labours under rack after of buck and deer antlers. As the hunting season reaches a climax, there is a steady flow of customers clutching heads to be gutted, boned and mounted as trophies. In Pennsylvania, 1.8 million hunting licences are granted every year. But over in the corner of the store there's something else going on. Two freezers are joined in the middle by tubing and a vacuum pump. And inside the two freezers, what were once pets are now being slowly dried out. Mike Mculloch can hardly believe the line of business he has entered into. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen\", he chuckles. \"I never started this taxidermy business to do dogs and cats. I bought the freeze dryers because we do small animals in them, that are very difficult, that are hard to skin and do the conventional way. \"And then this all started out about five years ago with a friend of a friend who asked me if I could help him out with his dog,\" he said. There's not much difference in the finished product between a stuffed animal and a freeze-dried one, Mike says. But stuffing is labour intensive for small animals; for a moose or a buck you gut and bone the head and neck and then stretch the hide over a polyurethane frame. But those frames aren't made for smaller animals - so the bone and muscle structure needs to be recreated - and that means the price goes to around $2,500. Which is where the freezer comes in. Freeze-drying - dropping the temperature of the animal to the point where water turns to a gas and then drawing the gas off with a vacuum pump - costs around one fifth of the price of stuffing. And customers are queuing up, with pets coming over from all over the States - so far he has taken in pets from Texas, California and Florida. \"I don't understand them,\" he says, adding, \"but then I don't understand people paying $2,000 to bury them and put a headstone up as well. It's a big business in this country - they cremate their dogs and cats and they spend three or four thousand dollars for an urn to put them in.\" Business is very good at Mac's Taxidermy; new freezers are on order and new investors want to set up a whole new pet freeze-drying company. Along with the success have come odd requests. One man in Ohio has asked, in return for a sum which Mike Mculloch will only describe as \"very substantial\", that his entire body be frozen. Mike is still pondering that one. Profit margins are up and so far there's little competition on the horizon; other taxidermists just aren't interested. Mike says he'll probably make more money this year in all the other years he has been in business. Deputise that one thing has changed for the worse - the mood in Mike's shop.

Next to the supermarket, a squat building covered with wooden boards has a pile of animal skins mouldering outside. It may seem surprising, but this could be the site of a revolution in pet preservation. Inside Mac's Taxidermy, Mike Mculloch labours under rack after of buck and deer antlers. As the hunting season reaches a climax, there is a steady flow of customers clutching heads to be gutted, boned and mounted as trophies. In Pennsylvania, 1.8 million hunting licences are granted every year. But over in the corner of the store there's something else going on. Two freezers are joined in the middle by tubing and a vacuum pump. And inside the two freezers, what were once pets are now being slowly dried out. Mike Mculloch can hardly believe the line of business he has entered into. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen\", he chuckles. \"I never started this taxidermy business to do dogs and cats. I bought the freeze dryers because we do small animals in them, that are very difficult, that are hard to skin and do the conventional way. \"And then this all started out about five years ago with a friend of a friend who asked me if I could help him out with his dog,\" he said. There's not much difference in the finished product between a stuffed animal and a freeze-dried one, Mike says. But stuffing is labour intensive for small animals; for a moose or a buck you gut and bone the head and neck and then stretch the hide over a polyurethane frame. But those frames aren't made for smaller animals - so the bone and muscle structure needs to be recreated - and that means the price goes to around $2,500. Which is where the freezer comes in. Freeze-drying - dropping the temperature of the animal to the point where water turns to a gas and then drawing the gas off with a vacuum pump - costs around one fifth of the price of stuffing. And customers are queuing up, with pets coming over from all over the States - so far he has taken in pets from Texas, California and Florida. \"I don't understand them,\" he says, adding, \"but then I don't understand people paying $2,000 to bury them and put a headstone up as well. It's a big business in this country - they cremate their dogs and cats and they spend three or four thousand dollars for an urn to put them in.\" Business is very good at Mac's Taxidermy; new freezers are on order and new investors want to set up a whole new pet freeze-drying company. Along with the success have come odd requests. One man in Ohio has asked, in return for a sum which Mike Mculloch will only describe as \"very substantial\", that his entire body be frozen. Mike is still pondering that one. Profit margins are up and so far there's little competition on the horizon; other taxidermists just aren't interested. Mike says he'll probably make more money this year in all the other years he has been in business. Deputise that one thing has changed for the worse - the mood in Mike's shop. It's gone from triumph to tragedy. \"We're used to people coming in here,\" he says \" and they're all excited - they've got a big buck, or a bear or a mountain lion, and they're all excited. It's completely different now - the people come in with their dogs and cats and they're crying. I understand it but it's a completely different things for us.

The business initially focuses on preserving large game animals such as deer and elk, but has since taken a surprising turn with a new demand: preserving the bodies of small animals, specifically pets like dogs and cats.\n\nMike explains that he started the business to cater to his friend's friend who asked him to freeze-dry their pet dog. He invested in freeze dryers, which he initially used for preserving small animals, such as rodents and squirrels. However, after getting requests to preserve pets, he began using the freeze-dryers on dogs and cats as well.\n\nThe technique of freeze-drying, also known as sublimation, slowly removes the moisture from the animal's body, preserving it in a dehydrated state. Mike says this method costs about one-fifth of the price of traditional taxidermy, making it a more affordable option for families who want to keep their pets' remains.\n\nAs a result, Mike's business has seen a significant surge in demand, with pet owners from across the country bringing in their deceased pets to be preserved. While he is thrilled with the success of his business, Mike expresses a sense of melancholy, noting that the atmosphere in his shop has changed. The people coming in are no longer enthusiastic about the process of taxidermy, but instead appear emotional, as they are parting with the companionship of their", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.080682368868707, "p": 1.8804074664036108e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 194, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9257221221923828, "Recall": 0.9000334143638611, "Accuracy": 0.9141666889190674}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9257221221923828, "Recall": 0.9000334143638611, "Accuracy": 0.9141666889190674}, "total_statistics": [2692.0, 2793.0, 216.0, 299.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2692.0, 2793.0, 216.0, 299.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 16}

RFA recently learned that the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has accused him of espionage on behalf of unnamed foreign powers. RFA contacted Liem in Ho Chi Minh City and spoke with him on the morning of August 28. The interview was aired in its entirety on August 28 during the 9 to 10 p.m. broadcast to Vietnam. Among his remarks to RFA's Vietnamese service, Le Quang Liem, 80, shared several important pieces of information. The government of Vietnam accuses him, through an intensive press campaign, of being the henchman of foreign powers to plot the \"overthrow of the legal and constitutional government of Vietnam.\" This campaign began in April. Conversely, the CPV had also informally sought Liem's cooperation to be made chairman of an advisory committee on religious questions. \"I have refused and said it will not do. Why, they asked me. I said that... a religion should be independent and not be an appurtenance of the government. Let them organize a public conference gathering all the major leaders of the Hoa Hao in the nation - the conference can even be presided over by a government person - and let them present their opinions. Only then can we know what they want. And to start with, the government should not interfere or try to guide them one way or the other. This will not do.\" He also spoke of his rebuff of an attempt to draw him into a scheme that would have embarrassed the government on April 30 - the anniversary of the fall of Saigon. In response to the suggestion Liem said, \"my stand is a purely religious stand, I do not engage in politics and I do not cause disturbances. My struggle, while very tough, is also non-violent. I believe that all violence and sabotage only causes misery to people and harms them.\" Even if a grenade can kill a communist leader, he would be replaced right away by another, according to Mr. Liem. \"That is why I believe that killing people is not the solution whereas the real need of the Vietnamese people at the present time is freedom, the restoration of freedom. Now, freedom and human rights happen to be the main trend of the whole world. That is why we should struggle...to get the support of the whole world and force a change of direction on the communist regime, so that they have to grant the people their basic freedoms. That is the main point.\" Le Quang Liem also said he does not believe in the establishment of a government-in-exile especially since the main powers, including the United States, have changed direction from military confrontation to a policy of peaceful engagement. \"As for the distribution of leaflets, grenade throwing, setting off land mines or other explosives, these are all murderous weapons killing the innocent. That is a crime and I am incapable of such a crime.\" In closing, Liem said: \"They want to come for me? I am ready. I tell you, I am not sure where my struggle will lead me, and it's sort of doubtful that I will be able to help my church very much. I might end up in jail or even get killed, it's all equal to me.\" RFA just learned that yesterday, August 28, Nguyen Van Dien, second in command to Le Quang Liem, has been arrested by the authorities - possibly in connection with the same charge leveled at Liem.

Does the CYP3A5 genotype affect the trough plasma concentrations of ATV and LPV in substance abusers versus non-substance abusers?\n\n**Background**\n\nCYP3A5 is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates, including HIV-1 PIs like ATV and LPV. Variability in CYP3A5 expression and activity is well-known and depends heavily on the individual's racial ancestry. The study highlights two key aspects of this polymorphism:\n\n*   The polymorphism's role in the variability of PI pharmacokinetics and potential for therapeutic failure or toxicity.\n*   The possibility of genotype-based therapeutic drug monitoring to maximize the efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

The timing wasn't right. And what could have been is now a gym up for auction. WAVELAND \u2013 Inside Waveland gym with its musty smells and wooden bleachers and peeling brick walls, what could have been is unmistakably raw. This gym is 1954 \u2013 frozen in time. Plopped in the middle of a tiny town \u2014 population 419 \u2014 in the southwest corner of Montgomery County, the gym is a reminder of a time when basketball ruled. Waveland was a powerhouse in the 1950s. No one in the county could beat the Hornets. The stage at the end of the gym, meant for school plays, had folding chairs on Friday nights, seats for fans when the bleachers were packed to the walls. People would pour out into the school halls on tiptoes, trying to catch a glimpse of the action. Wire bingo-calling contraptions lie on the side of the court \u2013 wooden balls inside with their faded B-5s and G-54s. They are dust-covered reminders of the the chili suppers that took place before home games, when townswomen brought in their cream pies and chocolate steam cakes. The locker rooms are suffocating, barely wide enough for two players going opposite directions to pass. One toilet. Two urinals. A dozen metal lockers. The windows in the dank basement are shut now. But in the 1950s, players would leave them unlatched so they could sneak in to shoot in the dark gym. The producers of \u201cHoosiers\u201d saw the magic. They came to visit the gym, built in 1937, in the early 1980s. They saw the perfect spot to film their iconic movie based on the Milan miracle of 1954. But the timing didn\u2019t work out. And no one in Waveland knew. They had no idea what their little pocket of Indiana was missing out on. The school board got the request from Angelo Pizzo, an unknown writer and filmmaker from Bloomington, who was working on his first movie. The premise of the film: A small town Indiana school wins a state basketball championship, featuring the fictional team of Hickory Huskers, which was loosely based on the real 1954 Milan team. But the Waveland board had already signed contracts and the town had passed a bond to demolish the old school attached to the gym and build an elementary school. \"We were looking for one location where we could shoot it all,\" Pizzo said in the book \"Historic Hoosier Gyms,\" written by IndyStar's Kyle Neddenriep. \"The school, the downtown square, the gym \u2014 all of it. We found the perfect place at Waveland.\" But despite pleas from Pizzo and his partner, David Anspaugh, to hold off on the construction, Waveland voted no to \"Hoosiers\" being filmed at their gym. \"Unfortunately we got word of 'Hoosiers' a little too late,\" said Mike Mitchell, who was on the school board at the time. \"It\u2019s too bad, because Waveland had everything we needed \u2014 the town, the gym, the school,\" Anspaugh said years later. Instead, the fictional town of Hickory was shot in three different locations: New Richmond, Nineveh and, for the gym, Knightstown. That Knightstown gym, now called The Hoosier Gym, has reinvented itself into a museum and community center. The Waveland gym, vacant and full of so many memories, is up for auction next month. It is being sold with the now-vacated elementary school. \"That gym was a big deal to the community,\" said Ralph Jones, who owns the property with his wife, Brenda. The couple had tried for several years to get a charter or Christian school going. \"That's what I'd like to see happen,\" Jones said. \"Outside of that, as long as it\u2019s good for the community, then it's good with me.\" Other have talked of turning the gym and school into a community center or, perhaps, offices. Mitchell, who was a standout player at Waveland in the 1960s and ended his career as the second-leading scorer in school history with 1,473 career points, said he is torn about the sale of the gym. \"I have no idea what it should be. I hate to see it just decay,\" said Mitchell, who was also the first Waveland player to achieve a 50-point game. \"I\u2019ve seen a few gyms that have been abandoned over the years and I guess they kind of die a slow death. I would hate to see that happen to it.\" The Waveland Hornets had incredible success from 1949 to 1953, winning the sectionals four times. They were 25-0 in 1951 before losing 50-49 to Covington in the regional final at Clinton. \"It was very much like Hoosiers,\" said Mitchell, who grew up next to the Waveland gym. Keith Greve was a star of the team during that era and went on to start four years at Butler University, playing for Tony Hinkle. He was later inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. His brother, Bill Greve, graduated as the career scoring leader at Waveland and in Montgomery County history with 1,777 points. That placed him fifth in Indiana high school basketball history when he graduated in 1955. He went on to play four years for Purdue and was inducted this year into Indiana's hall of fame. There was most certainly magic that happened inside that gym \u2014 whether it ever made it to the big screen or not. \"You wouldn't believe the stuff I get to see,\" said Paul Miner, who works for Lawson & Co., the auction company that is selling the property, as he looks up at the vintage scoreboard hanging in the gym. \"Yep. This is what Indiana basketball was about.\" The Waveland gym was last used as a high school gym in 1971, when the school consolidated with Ladoga and New Market to form Southmont that year. From then on, it was part of the elementary school. But when the elementary school was demolished in the 1980s to make way for a new one, the gym remained. No one wanted to see it go. Built in 1937, the Waveland gym was a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The school at the time was kindergarten through 12th grade \u2014 about 250 students total. Many of the graduating classes had 13 to 15 students, said Dave Fullenwider, who attended Waveland until it was consolidated in 1971. Through the years, so much has happened inside that gym. Fall carnivals, Christmas programs, community meetings. Fullenwider said in the 1950s, on Friday nights, two ticket booths would set up outside of the gym. People would line up along the sidewalk to buy tickets to the game before school let out. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, the gym remained packed for basketball. \"'Hoosiers' (producers) came in there and said the town was perfect, the school was perfect, the gym was perfect,\" said Fullenwider. \"A first grade teacher at the time said, 'They were dying to film here.'\" Alas, that didn't happen. And what could have been has passed. \"I'd like to see something good come of it,\" said Fullenwider. \"I just hate to see it torn down, especially with the rich history of the gym.\" See the inside story of Indiana's rich tradition of high school basketball in IndyStar's new hardcover book, \"History of Our Hysteria: Indiana High School Basketball.\" This collector's item will feature stunning historic images and compelling stories, and is sure to be a showpiece on your coffee table.

However, the town of Waveland declined the producers' request to use the gym for filming due to construction plans for a new elementary school that would have demolished the entire school complex.\n\nThe Waveland gym features many original elements, including a vintage scoreboard, dust-covered wire bingo-calling contraptions, and a bathroom that once contained a single toilet and two urinals. The gym has hosted numerous community events, including fall carnivals, Christmas programs, and basketball games, and was the site of the Hornets' historic 1954 basketball teams. The Hornets were undefeated at 25-0 in 1951 before losing to Covington in the regional final.\n\nThe town's rejection of the producers' request has left many community members feeling regretful or nostalgic about the potential loss of a beloved piece of Indiana basketball history. The auctioning of the gym, combined with the demolition of the original elementary school, threatens to erase much of that history.\n\nSome potential buyers have expressed interest in turning the gym into a community center or offices, while others have expressed concern about preserving the building's historical integrity.

He wrote the speech that Ronald Reagan, poised dramatically under a bust of Lenin, delivered to students at Moscow State University. The event was a highpoint of the Moscow summit. Now Josh Gilder is working for George Bush - crafting the first of many speeches which he hopes will help put the vice-president over the top in the fall elections. ``I'm struggling with the transition, because I'm writing for a candidate versus the President,'' says the youthful Mr. Gilder, even though he is not a newcomer to the Bush operation. He worked as a Bush speechriter for two years before being tapped for the presidential job in late 1985. The struggle is understandable. The President's delivery is so impeccable that even a bad speech can be made to sound good. Vice-President Bush, on the other hand, does not have the reputation of a good speaker, especially when he is viewed on television. Bush, he adds, although he is younger than Reagan, is a more old-fashioned politician who got his experience on the stump in Texas, delivering extemporaneous remarks on the back of a pick-up truck five times a day. Reagan, by contrast, is a politician of the television age. If Bush does not come through well on TV, says Gilder, his strengths lie in his knowledge of the issues and the fact that he is an honest man. ``He couldn't dissemble if he tried,'' says the speechwriter. It is clear that Gilder already is thinking in terms of Bush as a doer, perhaps in response to the Democrats' effort to build up Dukakis as a pragmatic manager. ``Reagan is the great visionary and Bush is the man that can implement that vision,'' he says. He cites the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Arms) Treaty. The ``vision'' was the two-track policy of negotiation and deployment that led to the treaty. But it was George Bush who convinced the allies to move ahead with deployment of the nuclear missiles in the face of domestic opposition. A political speechwriter does not make up his own ideas, of course. He seeks to capture and embody his client's views and values. In the case of Reagan, says Gilder, he went back to the President's 1964 ``A Time for Choice'' speech in support of Barry Goldwater to understand his most fundamental views. It helps, of course, to share those views. Although he attended Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts institution where he studied literature and music, Gilder is an unabashed conservative. After graduation he wrote for such conservative periodicals as American Spectator, the Wall Street Journal, and New Criterion. After joining the White House in 1983, Gilder's first speech for Bush was for a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating entrepreneurs. Later he wrote more substantial pieces, including the speech Bush delivered at a foreign policy conference in Vienna in 1983 on Yalta, in which he declared that the West would never accept the division of Europe. During his two years with Bush, he says, the vice-president penned a great deal himself. Sometimes he wrote out his ideas on a legal pad aboard a plane and handed it to a writer for crafting just before a public appearance. There is an art to writing for presidents and politicians. Gilder takes issue on which - when writing for someone for who is not a brilliant speaker - short, choppy sentences are called for. Speechwriting for the President is not a solo operation. A draft speech is vetted by many people, from White House and National Security Council aides to State and Defense officials. All can and often do suggest changes. Finally, the draft is shown to the President himself, who frequently makes substantive as well as editorial changes. While the White House has a stable of writers, many of whom earn a reputation in their own right, they do not tout their authorship of presidential speeches. The whole idea is to fashion a speech which, infused with the President's ideas and delivered with the rhythm uniquely his own, becomes ``his'' speech. In working on the speech, Gilder sought advice from James Billington, head of the Library of Congress and author of ``Icon and the Ax.'' He also talked with Yakov Smirnov, the Soviet 'emigr'e and standup comic who is becoming known to US audiences for his witty comments about Soviet society. The President, Gilder says, wanted to talk about the importance of freedom and what it means. Yakov, he says, helped make the theme concrete in terms of Soviets' own experience. Reagan ended up talking about freedom in churches, freedom in the schoolroom, freedom in the courtroom. He mentioned his own experience leading a union strike as president of the Screen Actors Guild. ``We are breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny,'' the President declared. Drawing on ideas uttered by Reagan over the decades, Gilder sought to make the speech not a ``challenge'' to the Soviet students, he says, but an ``embrace of the possibilities'' if the USSR opened up its system. Reagan praised Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform effort and voiced hope for its success. Reagan's speech was laced with the names of literary and other figures, among them Gogol, Pasternak, Lomonosov, George Washington. Even an Uzbek poet - Alisher Navoi. Though Reagan could not have known about all of them, the name-dropping had a purpose.

Bush, who recently wrote the speech that President Ronald Reagan delivered at Moscow State University in 1987. Gilder reflects on the similarities and differences between the two politicians and how he approaches writing for Bush, who is not as well-known a public speaker as Reagan was.\n\nGilder had previously worked with Bush for two years before being promoted to write presidential-style speeches. He notes that Bush's strengths lie in his knowledge of the issues and his honesty, while his delivery on television is not as strong as Reagan's. Gilder also emphasizes the importance of capturing Bush's words and values in his speeches, rather than just writing a generic speech that sounds good.\n\nTo write the speech that Reagan delivered at Moscow State University, Gilder studied Reagan's previous speeches and understood his fundamental views on issues, including his support for Barry Goldwater in 1964. Gilder also incorporated themes and ideas from Reagan's past speeches into the speech that Reagan delivered at the event, drawing inspiration from literary and other figures.\n\nGilder's approach to writing speeches for the President and vice-president highlights the challenges and nuances of speechwriting for politicians who have different communication styles. In addition to the article's focus on Gilder, who may be considered the voice behind many Reagan-era speeches, there is also the story about Bush's relationship with his speeches, including how often he dictates his ideas in handwritten notes.

DOJ says Officer Erik O'Brien fired fatal shot. GREEN BAY - A Green Bay man who was shot and killed Friday by Green Bay Police had been arrested earlier that night on a warrant for failing to report to jail for a 2017 drunken driving conviction. Jonathon C. Tubby, 26, was identified by the state Department of Justice on Friday as the man shot and killed Oct. 19 in the sally port at the Brown County Jail. The sally port is an enclosed, garage-like area where officers drive in, park and walk suspects to and from the jail. Two Green Bay Police officers, Erik O\u2019Brien and Colton Wernecke, are on paid administrative pending the outcome of an investigation of the shooting by DOJ's Division of Criminal Investigation. State law requires the investigation of police shootings be conducted by an outside agency. O'Brien was the only officer to fire his weapon during the incident, DOJ said. O'Brien is a six-year veteran of the department. Wernecke is a trainee with three months on the job. No other information about the shooting has been made public. The family asked for prayers, encouragement and support, in a statement released Friday by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. They also asked the community to respect their privacy and to refrain from speculation about the events surrounding Tubby's death. \"Through the night there have been stories and recollections of Jonathon and what a compassionate caring young man he was. Jonathon loved to dance, sing, and make people laugh. He was compassionate and took care of everybody he loved the best he could. He was very athletic and enjoyed football and lacrosse,\" the family's statement said. Tubby and a woman who has not been named by police were arrested for outstanding warrants during a traffic stop about 7:20 p.m. Oct. 19, near the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in the 300 block of Main Street, police said. Court records show a warrant for Tubby's arrest was issued in May after he failed to report to jail to serve a 60-day sentence for a May 2017 conviction of second-time drunken driving. Officers became concerned about Tubby's behavior while driving him to the Brown County Jail, according to online police radio archives. He was shot and died shortly after 9 p.m. In a statement, the DOJ said a large number of police officers were present when Tubby was shot because of the length of the incident at the jail. The investigation is expected to take about 60 days to complete. Police radio transmissions posted online shed some light on what happened the night of Tubby's death, including an 8:30 p.m. call in which an officer told the county dispatch center that Tubby had, \"something in his shirt, pointed up at his chin.\" About 8:55 p.m., officers reported being unable to see Tubby's face in the patrol car.

DOJ says Officer Erik O'Brien fired fatal shot. GREEN BAY - A Green Bay man who was shot and killed Friday by Green Bay Police had been arrested earlier that night on a warrant for failing to report to jail for a 2017 drunken driving conviction. Jonathon C. Tubby, 26, was identified by the state Department of Justice on Friday as the man shot and killed Oct. 19 in the sally port at the Brown County Jail. The sally port is an enclosed, garage-like area where officers drive in, park and walk suspects to and from the jail. Two Green Bay Police officers, Erik O\u2019Brien and Colton Wernecke, are on paid administrative pending the outcome of an investigation of the shooting by DOJ's Division of Criminal Investigation. State law requires the investigation of police shootings be conducted by an outside agency. O'Brien was the only officer to fire his weapon during the incident, DOJ said. O'Brien is a six-year veteran of the department. Wernecke is a trainee with three months on the job. No other information about the shooting has been made public. The family asked for prayers, encouragement and support, in a statement released Friday by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. They also asked the community to respect their privacy and to refrain from speculation about the events surrounding Tubby's death. \"Through the night there have been stories and recollections of Jonathon and what a compassionate caring young man he was. Jonathon loved to dance, sing, and make people laugh. He was compassionate and took care of everybody he loved the best he could. He was very athletic and enjoyed football and lacrosse,\" the family's statement said. Tubby and a woman who has not been named by police were arrested for outstanding warrants during a traffic stop about 7:20 p.m. Oct. 19, near the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in the 300 block of Main Street, police said. Court records show a warrant for Tubby's arrest was issued in May after he failed to report to jail to serve a 60-day sentence for a May 2017 conviction of second-time drunken driving. Officers became concerned about Tubby's behavior while driving him to the Brown County Jail, according to online police radio archives. He was shot and died shortly after 9 p.m. In a statement, the DOJ said a large number of police officers were present when Tubby was shot because of the length of the incident at the jail. The investigation is expected to take about 60 days to complete.

It's slightly smaller than a baseball. Crab cakes are kind of like Princess Bride Meghan Markle's wedding dress: Either you loved the simplicity or you wanted more adornment. I'm in the less-is-more camp, with both the dress and the crab cake. This summer, I'm on the hunt for the best places in Delaware to get a crab cake. While this isn't a new quest, it's been almost 10 years since our last Great Crab Cake search. I started at a perennial favorite, Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar in Lewes. The restaurant has been well-known for its crab cakes for more than 15 years and it remains a strong contender as a place to go for a memorable crab cake experience. Keep reading for more on Gilligan's. In my experience, Delaware diners seem to prefer patties made with sweet, unbroken hunks of colossal, jumbo lump, lump or back fin meat. The less said about claw meat, the better. Classic crab cake recipes can include crumbled saltines, eggs, mayonnaise, lemon butter and even bread soaked in milk. These are traditional bindings that hold the cakes together. Embellishments, like sprinkles of Old Bay seasoning, a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a small spoonful of dry or prepared mustard aren't uncommon. Crab cakes can be broiled, baked, sauteed or fried. Squabbles over the cooking methods are to be expected. Don't draw me into this fight, I'm not going to say one is better than another. Tell me where you go for hefty cakes packed with sweet meat, not overly seasoned, mushy-tasting, hockey puck-shaped disks that try to pass for one of our region's favorite foods. We'll check out your suggestions and feature some of the best ones throughout the summer. Email me at ptalorico@delawareonline.com. Almost every successful restaurant in Delaware has some kind of dish with crab meat. It's a staple of Mid-Atlantic cuisine, especially in the First State since the blue crab is common in all of Delaware's tidal waters. Crabbing also is a popular recreational resource and the blue crab tops the list of the state\u2019s economically important marine fish and shellfish. In Delaware, the blue crab season generally runs from the beginning of March through the end of November. Availability is dependent on the weather. Crab cakes can be on the pricey side because of the labor involved in getting the perishable meat. An average blue crab weighs about 1/3 pound, but the edible portion is quite low. An experienced crab picker can produce about 2 1/4 ounces of meat from each pound of live blue crabs, according to information from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. This is just about a 14 percent yield. The actual yield depends on the size of the individual crab and experience of the crab picker. Crab processors on the Eastern Shore have said they are worried about shortages and escalating prices this season because many plants don't have enough workers to pick crab meat, according to a story last month in The Baltimore Sun. The meat the employees pick is sold in area markets and to restaurants. Workers, who mostly come from Mexico, can't get visas due to a new lottery system started by the Trump administration, The Sun reported. Previously, visas were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Prices could rise throughout the summer as demand grows greater. Cheryl Tilton, owner of Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar, says crab meat prices recently have been \"through the roof.\" Tilton only uses jumbo lump crab meat for her crab cakes and usually purchases the meat from the Lewes Fishhouse or Samuels & Son Seafood Co., a wholesale restaurant supplier based in Philadelphia. The cost has been $28 a pound. \"I like the big lumps of crab meat,\" she says. \"We're hoping that we at least get through the season. There is a shortage.\" Joe Lasprogata, vice president of Samuels & Sons, says area restaurants buy both fresh and pasteurized crab meat. \"Both products are extremely expensive right now,\" he says. \"It's a crazy demand. We can't get enough live crabs. There's a huge demand in this area.\" Fresh crab meat is pricey because it's extremely perishable. \"It has to be used immediately,\" Lasprogata says. Pasteurized crab meat, which is easier for restaurants to use because it lasts longer and has no shells, usually comes from China, the Philippines and Indonesia, he says. Crab prices usually remain high throughout the summer, and then fall in September and October. While the crab cakes at Gilligan's have always been a high point of the eatery's menu, it had been years since I had one. If you haven't been there lately, the restaurant at 134 W. Market St. has undergone a complete transformation. When it reopened last year, the year-round business, next to the Inn at Canal Square, had a completely new look. The original restaurant had been built around a dry-docked, 38-foot cabin cruiser rescued from the Florida Keys, a corn crib salvaged from a historic building in Ellendale and a former chicken coop. But Tilton said she was tired of working in a building that was falling down around her, so that structure was razed. Now, a new building is in its place. Gilligan's has 62-seats indoors and 68-seats outdoor and a harbor view that overlooks the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal. There's also a private dining room that be rented for events like wedding rehearsal dinners and baby showers. The marina atmosphere fuels the urge for seafood. We pre-gamed with an appetizer of steamed Little Neck Clams ($13) immersed in a briny, brothy wine bath flecked with sweet corn and soppressata, a slightly spicy Italian cured meat. It's a very good beginning to a meal, though the \"crusty\" bread was almost too crusty. Leaving it to soften in their irresistible broth didn't help much. Not wanting to risk a possible trip to the dentist, we asked for replacement bread. But our server said all the bread that was available was just as \"crusty\" because it was made ahead of time. But we were really here for the crab cakes, and they did not disappoint. Calling Gilligan's crab concoction a cake is really a misnomer. This is a \"flash-fried\" crab ball that is, perhaps, just slightly smaller than a baseball. \"It's pretty big,\" Tilton says of the portion that's close to 10 ounces. \"Even though the prices have gone up, we still want to offer the same quality.\" Tilton says she has been using the same recipe \"as I've done all the time, since we started here 16 years ago.\" The jumbo lump crab meat is held together with only a whisper of mayonnaise. Then, it's rolled into panko breadcrumbs. Tilton says each cake is put into a fryer \"really quick,\" just so it gets crispy on the outside. \"That's the best way,\" she says. Believe her. The filling is all crab, pure and simple. It's a very ample portion and I could have easily split one with a friend. A crab cake sandwich, which comes with homemade potato chips, is $20. A crab cake entree, available after 5 p.m., is $30. It's served with fingerling potatoes and \"whatever seasonal vegetables we have,\" Tilton says. You also can get a crab cake (crab ball?) on a bed of greens or, for an extra charge, on top one of the restaurant's salads. I like the Power House Salad ($12), greens tossed with sliced avocado and carrots, along with chickpeas, alfalfa sprouts and cooked barley. Tilton says the restaurant's kitchen staff makes the crab cakes every morning for that day's service. She can also make them without the panko breadcrumbs, but only with advance notice. \"We have a few customers that are gluten-free and they call in advance. If you call in advance, and let's us know you're coming, and you've been here before, we can do it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "Calling the jumbo lump crab concoction at Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar in Lewes a cake is a misnomer.

This casual, waterfront eatery is a strong contender as a place to enjoy a memorable crab cake experience. They've undergone significant renovations recently and have expanded their 62-seat indoor and 68-seat outdoor seating to accommodate guests.

They are met with curiosity, indifference and open hostility. Jewish Israeli, Palestinian, and international activists carried three black panels bearing some 100 names through the streets of what is now the Givat Shaul neighborhood of West Jerusalem on Thursday. They marched to commemorate the massacre and displacement of the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin by Zionist militias 66 years ago on April 9, 1948. Organized by the Israeli organization Zochrot, whose name means \u201cremembering,\u201d the event memorialized those killed and recounted the village\u2019s history to Israeli passers-by, who were at times curious, indifferent and hostile. A woman passing the procession as it assembled on Kanfey Nesharim Street complained to her companion, \u201cOh, it must be that Deir Yassin crap.\u201d A young worker in a sandwich shop asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d and snapped a photo with his iPhone. Just three days prior, vandals had spray-painted \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d on grave markers in Deir Yassin\u2019s cemetery. As the participants carried the names along what was once the main street of a thriving Palestinian village, it was most often children who stopped to listen to Zochrot\u2019s Umar Al-Ghubari recount the significance of a particular location along the way, or to read the names of the dead. The Deir Yassin massacre was a pivotal moment of the Nakba and in the lead-up to the 1948 War. Some 100-200 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed by the extremist Zionist militias the Irgun (Etzel) and Stern Gang (Lehi). Some were shot in battle, others executed. Others were killed when grenades were thrown into their houses. In some cases, whole families were gunned down. Exact numbers of the dead were disputed from the start, as even the perpetrators of the massacre inflated the death toll in order to sow terror throughout other Palestinian communities so that they would flee their homes. Other villages did indeed flee in fear, but the massacre also cemented the motivation of neighboring Arab countries to fight rather than accept partition. A member of the Hagana Zionist militia present for Thursday\u2019s procession recounted his role in the massacre: removing the bodies after the Irgun and Stern Gang had done most of the dirty work. He described it as the worst thing he ever experienced. My grandmother\u2019s cousin, Naziha Radwan, was six at the time of the massacre. She survived by covering herself in her grandmother\u2019s blood, hiding beneath stiffened bodies and pretending to be dead. It was hard to imagine these horrific events taking place on what now is a busy city street lined with shops and restaurants, eventually terminating in a park with playgrounds, basketball courts, and the Kfar Shaul mental hospital, whose buildings include a few of the original homes that were once the center of the village. Across the valley lies the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. In the aftermath of the massacre, prominent Jewish scholars, including Martin Buber, urged Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to leave Deir Yassin uninhabited, or at least that its settlement be postponed, writing that it had become \u201cinfamous throughout the Jewish world, the Arab world and the whole world.\u201d Their repeated messages were ignored. Prior to the massacre, we were on good terms with the Jews in Givat Shaul. We shared food, celebrated together, paid condolences to one another, babysat for each other. There was peace here before the Zionists came and destroyed everything. Zochrot\u2019s mission is \u201cto challenge the Israeli Jewish public\u2019s preconceptions and promote awareness, political and cultural change within it to create the conditions for the Return of Palestinian Refugees and a shared life in this country.\u201d While getting the Israeli Jewish public to acknowledge the injustices of the Nakba in general and the massacre of Deir Yassin in particular may be an unpopular uphill battle, a shared life based on a just and lasting peace will not be possible without such truth-telling. The British National Archives released in April last year, contained a report written by Sir Alan Cunningham, the last High Commissionar of the British Mandate authority in Palestine, dated April 30, 1948. In the report Cunningham mentioned the massacre at Deir Yassin by calling the Jewish militia which carried the massacre, \u201cterrorists, Nazis and savages\u201d. Our one eyed Rehmat strikes again. Obviously Arabs did die in Deir Yassin. That is beyond dispute. But was it an atrocity? And if it was, then was it exaggerated out of all proportion? According to some Arab notables and eye witnesses, it certainly WAS exaggerated.

The head of the Haganah Intelligence Service in Jerusalem, Yitzhak Levy, wrote in reports dated April 12 and 13: \u201cThe conquest of the village was carried out with great brutality, whole families [including] women, old people and children were killed and there are piles and piles of dead.\u201d He wrote that a mother and child who had been moved from Deir Yassin to Sheikh Badr were killed there by Lehi fighters. Seven old men and women, who had been taken to Jerusalem, were taken back to Deir Yassin and killed in the quarry there, he wrote, and an Arab man, believed to be a sniper, was killed and his corpse burned in front of foreign journalists. Jacques de Reynier, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Palestine, and his assistant Dr. Alfred Engel, visited Deir Yassin on April 11. In his personal memoirs, published in 1950, Reynier wrote: \u201ca total of more than 200 dead, men, women, and children. About 150 cadavers have not been preserved inside the village in view of the danger represented by the bodies\u2019 decomposition.

The gang [the Irgun detachment] was wearing country uniforms with helmets. All of them were young, some even adolescents, men and women, armed to the teeth: revolvers, machine-guns, hand grenades, and also cutlasses in their hands, most of them still blood-stained. A beautiful young girl, with criminal eyes, showed me hers still dripping with blood; she displayed it like a trophy.

About 150 cadavers have not been preserved inside the village in view of the danger represented by the bodies\u2019 decomposition. They have been gathered, transported some distance, and placed in a large trough (I have not been able to establish if this is a pit, a grain silo, or a large natural excavation). \u2026 [One body was] a woman who must have been eight months pregnant, hit in the stomach, with powder burns on her dress indicating she\u2019d been shot point-blank.\u201d He wrote that he had encountered a \u201ccleaning-up team\u201d when he arrived the village. The gang [the Irgun detachment] was wearing country uniforms with helmets. All of them were young, some even adolescents, men and women, armed to the teeth: revolvers, machine-guns, hand grenades, and also cutlasses in their hands, most of them still blood-stained. A beautiful young girl, with criminal eyes, showed me hers still dripping with blood; she displayed it like a trophy. This was the \u201ccleaning up\u201d team, that was obviously performing its task very conscientiously.", "generated_text": "The article discusses a recent commemoration event in West Jerusalem to mark the 66th anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre, in which Zionist militias killed around 100-200 Palestinians, including women and children, in 1948. The event was organized by the Israeli organization Zochrot, which aimed to remember those killed and recount the village's history to Israeli passers-by, who were largely curious, indifferent, and hostile.\n\nThe author notes that the massacre was a pivotal moment of the Nakba and led to the displacement of the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin. Some of the dead were killed in battle, executed, or killed when grenades were thrown into their houses, while others were gunned down in whole families.\n\nThe article quotes from various sources, including a member of the Hagana Zionist militia who participated in the massacre, and Hazem Nusseibeh, a member of one of Jerusalem's most prominent Arab families, who worked as an editor of the Palestine Broadcasting Service's Arabic news in 1948. Nusseibeh recounts how the event was seen as an atrocity by the Arab community, while some Arab notables argue that it was not exaggerated.\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of truth-telling about the Nakba and the Deir Yassin massacre in creating a shared life based on a just and lasting peace in Israel.

Vacation plans are naturally \"SMART.\" They are Specific, Measurable, Assigned, Realistic and Time-Bound. Pick the place, set the date, pay for the trip and go. If you think about it, none of us really have 365 days a year to work. Weekends and work holidays erase more than 100. What you really have is 200 days a year to make it happen.

I productized my service so clients can subscribe by credit card. Now I get paid even while I'm away. Paying percentage points to my processing vendors is worth it. If you hate billing and collections like I do, create subscribers, not customers. Passive income is even better (via investments, affiliate arrangements, etc.). 4. Hire the right partners, managers and experts. You and your team should be able to work from anywhere. Captain Jean-Luc Picard had his number one. Who's yours? Hire your No. 1 as quickly as possible to help out when you're away. He or she can be a virtual assistant, but a vested right-hand COO \"commander\" has worked better for me. All of my businesses have been partnerships. Like marriages, making them work is worth it. 5. Identify vulnerabilities and continuously improve. Nothing shows cracks in your processes like going on vacation. Of course, this presumes your team follows standard operating procedures. But it's your responsibility as the owner to work on your business systems, as Michael Gerber advises. Systems are more than just checklists. Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline, wants us to leverage our systems' interdependencies. The best systems create whole value beyond the sum of its parts. A business is a system of systems; it's much more valuable when the owner isn't its key vulnerability. 6. Return refreshed and rejuvenated. Some of our vacations are more hectic than day-to-day business life. And many of us return to more work piled up than before. But disconnecting from daily work is supposed to help us reconnect with our purpose, passion and priorities. I like to allow myself a one-day staycation after a trip.

By prioritizing vacations as SMART goals, you're forcing yourself to make time for them and ensure they align with your business needs. This mindset can help you maintain a healthy work-life balance and avoid burnout.\n\n2. **Creating recurring and passive income streams**: Building recurring and passive income streams is a key strategy for maintaining a successful business while also having the freedom to take vacations. This can include anything from productized services to investments and affiliate arrangements. By diversifying your income streams, you can reduce your reliance on billable hours and have a safety net to fall back on while you're away.\n\n3. **Hiring the right partners, managers, and experts**: Building a strong team is essential for scaling your business and creating a sustainable business model. By hiring a trusted and capable right-hand person, you can ensure that your business continues to run smoothly while you're away on vacation.\n\n4. **Identifying vulnerabilities and continuously improving**: This is a critical aspect of maintaining a successful business.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they must change. In times of economic crisis, companies are quick to slash IT costs. With fears of a recession looming over the corporate world, CIOs are facing the axe once again. But no matter how many times CIOs proclaim their strategic value--or the strategic value of their departments--businesses too often view IT as a cost, plain and simple. IT executives have been rallying against that perception for years, but they're getting little attention. Howard Rubin says it's about time that changed. An IT benchmarking pioneer and self-proclaimed \"metrics arms dealer,\" Rubin is a former fellow with corporate strategy consultancy Norton, Nolan & Co., where he developed metrics for application portfolios and helped create the balanced business scorecard. He also serves as a senior adviser to Gartner and a research affiliate to the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management. A former executive vice president of META Group and professor emeritus of computer science at Hunter College of the City University of New York, Rubin has been an IT adviser to the U.S., Canadian, Indian and other governments. Rubin says businesses see better results when they make sound IT investments during economic downturns. When they don't, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. And the cost of catching up, he says, can be insurmountable. But CIOs are as guilty as their bosses in misinterpreting the true value of IT investments. To turn the tables, Rubin says, IT executives must recast the conventional language around IT expenditures and strategy. Rubin recently spoke with CIO Insight online editor Brian P. Watson about what companies do wrong in valuing their IT investments, and what CIOs must do to change that perception. What follows is an edited transcript of their discussion. CIO INSIGHT: What's the biggest problem today with the way companies view their IT investments? Rubin: It's been a long-term problem: Most companies view their IT investment as a cost and therefore they try to minimize the cost. Corporate leaders always ask me how they can use benchmarks to compare themselves with their peers, and how they can compare against best in class. Best in class, in conventional wisdom, is typically who's doing IT for the least amount of dollars, relative to revenue, relative to operating expense. Best in class sometimes is synonymous with who's the low cost in IT. That's a big problem, because the low cost may not be the best user of IT. When people talk about understanding how to calibrate themselves, they need to redefine best in class in terms of the aspirations of the business. Best in class could be, what's the spending pattern of the companies that are most profitable in our industry the last three years, or what are the spending patterns of the companies that have increased their business performance earnings per share the last three years? Companies treat IT like a cost and look for outside validation to drive costs down. They really should be looking at the outcome. What should I do with my IT strategy, my IT investment; am I maximizing return? That's better from a business perspective. Companies understand that IT produces value. But they view IT as a cost because it's so much harder to figure out where the value shows up in terms they can get their hands on.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they must change. In times of economic crisis, companies are quick to slash IT costs. With fears of a recession looming over the corporate world, CIOs are facing the axe once again. But no matter how many times CIOs proclaim their strategic value--or the strategic value of their departments--businesses too often view IT as a cost, plain and simple. IT executives have been rallying against that perception for years, but they're getting little attention. Howard Rubin says it's about time that changed. An IT benchmarking pioneer and self-proclaimed \"metrics arms dealer,\" Rubin is a former fellow with corporate strategy consultancy Norton, Nolan & Co., where he developed metrics for application portfolios and helped create the balanced business scorecard. He also serves as a senior adviser to Gartner and a research affiliate to the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management. A former executive vice president of META Group and professor emeritus of computer science at Hunter College of the City University of New York, Rubin has been an IT adviser to the U.S., Canadian, Indian and other governments. Rubin says businesses see better results when they make sound IT investments during economic downturns. When they don't, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. And the cost of catching up, he says, can be insurmountable. But CIOs are as guilty as their bosses in misinterpreting the true value of IT investments. To turn the tables, Rubin says, IT executives must recast the conventional language around IT expenditures and strategy. Rubin recently spoke with CIO Insight online editor Brian P. Watson about what companies do wrong in valuing their IT investments, and what CIOs must do to change that perception. What follows is an edited transcript of their discussion. CIO INSIGHT: What's the biggest problem today with the way companies view their IT investments? Rubin: It's been a long-term problem: Most companies view their IT investment as a cost and therefore they try to minimize the cost. Corporate leaders always ask me how they can use benchmarks to compare themselves with their peers, and how they can compare against best in class. Best in class, in conventional wisdom, is typically who's doing IT for the least amount of dollars, relative to revenue, relative to operating expense. Best in class sometimes is synonymous with who's the low cost in IT. That's a big problem, because the low cost may not be the best user of IT. When people talk about understanding how to calibrate themselves, they need to redefine best in class in terms of the aspirations of the business. Best in class could be, what's the spending pattern of the companies that are most profitable in our industry the last three years, or what are the spending patterns of the companies that have increased their business performance earnings per share the last three years? Companies treat IT like a cost and look for outside validation to drive costs down. They really should be looking at the outcome. What should I do with my IT strategy, my IT investment; am I maximizing return? That's better from a business perspective. Companies understand that IT produces value. But they view IT as a cost because it's so much harder to figure out where the value shows up in terms they can get their hands on. They gravitate to what's tangible, and what's tangible is the budget item. When you look at annual reports, go to \"operating expense.\" First you find \"compensation,\" and then you find \"communications and technology.\" IT, also through accounting principles, just makes itself look like a cost. The businesses themselves aren't necessarily cost-focused: IT shows up as a cost and finding the value is much more elusive; it's a self-feeding system.", "generated_text": "According to Howard Rubin, a renowned IT benchmarking expert, companies get it wrong when valuing their IT investments. He identifies several key issues:\n\n1. **Viewing IT as a cost**: Companies tend to treat IT as a cost to be minimized, rather than a strategic investment that can drive business benefits.\n2. **Misusing benchmarks**: Companies look for \"best in class\" IT providers who offer the lowest costs, rather than those that maximize ROI or business performance.\n3. **Focusing on tangible costs**: Companies prioritize visible costs, such as compensation and communications and technology expenses, over intangible benefits like value creation and ROI.\n4. **Lack of outcome-focused thinking**: Companies fail to evaluate the effectiveness of their IT investments in terms of business outcomes, such as increased earnings per share or revenue growth.\n5. **Difficulty in measuring value**: Companies struggle to quantify and track the value created by IT investments, making it harder to justify resource allocation and investments.\n\nTo change this perception, Rubin recommends that CIOs and IT executives:\n\n1. **Reframe IT expenditures**: View IT investments as strategic business initiatives that drive performance and growth, rather than just costs to be minimized.\n2. **Redefine \"best in class\"**: Look for IT providers or IT strategies that maximize business value, rather than just offering low costs.\n3. **Foster outcome-focused thinking**: Evaluate IT investments based on their impact on business outcomes, rather than just tangible costs.\n4. **Im", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.4641016151377544, "p": 0.00026600275256960515, "detected_greenlist_number": 180, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8869828581809998, "Recall": 0.8816449642181396, "Accuracy": 0.8849999904632568}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8869828581809998, "Recall": 0.8816449642181396, "Accuracy": 0.8849999904632568}, "total_statistics": [2637.0, 2673.0, 336.0, 354.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2637.0, 2673.0, 336.0, 354.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 42}

Walker did not rule on the claim of jury misconduct and left open the possibility that he would hear testimony from jurors on the issue later. Walker also did not rule on Hubbard's motion for a new trial during this morning's hearing, which lasted about two hours. The judge denied prosecutors' request to order Hubbard to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the state. A Lee County jury convicted Hubbard on 12 felony ethics charges in June. Walker sentenced him to four years in prison and ordered him to pay $210,000 in fines. Hubbard, who is out on bond, attended this morning's hearing. In July, Hubbard's lawyers filed a motion asking for an investigation after a juror gave the defense a sworn statement saying that other jurors made comments during the trial indicating a bias against Hubbard. Hubbard's motion asks for an investigation by the Lee County Sheriff's Department or \"another similarly situated neutral law enforcement agency.\" Walker, however, said he found no precedent in case law for such an investigation and that he was not inclined to be a \"pioneer.\" Walker said he was prepared to hear testimony on the matter, including from the juror who gave the affidavit. Hubbard attorney Bill Baxley said the defense was not prepared to call witnesses today but wanted, instead, to let the sheriff investigate and present findings to the court. This morning, Walker called to the witness stand two bailiffs who worked the case. In response to questions from the judge, both said they did not hear witnesses discussing the case. The two said they alternated sitting beside the jury box during the trial. Walker also called Court Administrator Patricia Campbell to the witness stand. The juror who gave the affidavit alleging jury bias brought those concerns to Campbell during the trial, according to the affidavit. Campbell testified today that a juror told her that another juror was making comments in the jury box such as \"uh huh,\" \"yes\" and \"now the truth is coming out.\" Campbell said she told Walker, who directed her to tell a bailiff to speak with the juror making the comments. That bailiff, Bobby Bond, testified that Campbell told him to talk to a juror who was making comments under her breath. Bond said he called the juror aside and told her not to do that. Bond said no other complaints about the jury were brought to his attention. Hubbard's lawyers pressed their claim of jury misconduct after hearing today's testimony. \"There's no way Mike Hubbard got a fair trial,\" attorney Lance Bell told Walker. Prosecutors have said Hubbard is seeking an \"unfettered fishing expedition into the jury\" by his request for an investigation. They say the affidavit alleging misconduct is inadmissible because rules of evidence exclude juror testimony about \"internal influences\" on the jury. Before Walker sentenced Hubbard, prosecutors asked him to order Hubbard to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the state under the reasoning that the state was the victim of his crimes. Walker rejected that argument before sentencing and did so again today. The amount, $1.1 million, was the total amount of consulting contract payments and business investments Hubbard received from the transactions for which he was convicted. Prosecutors had argued that Hubbard should not be allowed to keep \"ill-gotten gains obtained as a result of breaching the public's trust.\" \"It would be a just order for this court to enter because this defendant has no legitimate right to that money,\" Deputy Attorney General Mike Duffy told Walker. Baxley called their request a \"ludicrous claim,\" saying that Hubbard's case did not involve taking any money from the state or any payments made by the state. \"They're just seeking a windfall and trying to be vindictive,\" Baxley said. Baxley told Walker the strongest reason that a new trial is justified was the testimony of former Ethics Commission Executive Director Jim Sumner. Sumner testified as an expert witness for the state. He testified about finer points of the ethics law, including the definition of \"principal,\" the legal term for a person or business that hires a lobbyist, and about what kind of transactions would be covered under a friendship exception in the ethics law. Baxley said the defense was not properly notified of Sumner's expert testimony and had no chance to try to rebut it. \"We were blindsided, bushwhacked and ambushed,\" Baxley said. Among Hubbard's convictions are that he solicited and received investments of $150,000 for his debt-strapped Craftmaster Printers business from each of four business executives. The jury found the investments violated the ethics law prohibition against a public official receiving a thing of value from a principal because the four men were officials in companies that employ lobbyists. Three of the four, Great Southern Wood President Jimmy Rane, Hoar Construction President Robert Burton and former Business Council of Alabama Chairman Will Brooke, all testified that they were longtime friends of Hubbard. Hubbard's lawyers argue that the friendship exception should have applied to their investments in Hubbard's business and the transactions were not crimes. Assistant Attorney General Megan Fitzpatrick said the jury made the determination of whether the friendship exception applied after hearing all the testimony and evidence. Walker asked prosecutors about Rane's investment in Craftmaster Printers, noting that Rane testified that Rane and Hubbard had been friends since the 1980s. Rane made the investment from personal funds, not his company's funds. \"Where is the connection between Great Southern Wood and Craftmaster?\" Walker asked prosecutors. Kirkpatrick told the judge that Rane's status as a principal did not change because he used personal funds to make the investment. She noted that a transaction does not have to be a \"quid pro quo,\" an official action in exchange for money or a favor, to be a crime under the ethics law. Sumner had testified that the friendship exception was intended to apply to exchanges like gifts or shared expenses on a joint vacation. Deputy Attorney General Duffy told Walker said Alabama has the \"toughest ethics law in the country\" because it defines individuals who are officials with companies that hire lobbyists as principals, not just the companies themselves.

Hubbard's lawyers argued that the case did not involve taking money from the state, and that the defense was not properly notified of expert testimony by the former Ethics Commission Executive Director Jim Sumner. The defense also argued that the jury made the determination of whether the friendship exception applied to their investments in Hubbard's business and the transactions were not crimes.\n\nJudge Walker rejected the request for restitution, stating that Hubbard", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.50333209967908, "p": 3.3448111130818248e-06, "detected_greenlist_number": 189, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9164976477622986, "Recall": 0.8920697569847107, "Accuracy": 0.9041666388511658}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9164976477622986, "Recall": 0.8920697569847107, "Accuracy": 0.9041666388511658}, "total_statistics": [2711.0, 2714.0, 247.0, 328.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2711.0, 2714.0, 247.0, 328.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 45}

Three years ago, I caught H1N1, or swine flu. Barely mobile for a week, I had nothing better to do than bemoan my poor fate on Facebook. Judging by the fretful litany of symptoms that pops up in my newsfeed during flu season, this is still a socially acceptable response to illness. The Internet is also an acceptable outlet for admissions of physical insecurities, personal failings, and up-to-the-minute reporting on any and all inconveniences. This isn\u2019t new. People love to whine. In Stalinist Russia, though it could be deadly, there was a culture of public complaint. Stores might not have had items on the shelves, but they did have comment books. Criticism and self-criticism were practices not only encouraged, but outright demanded of conscious citizens. Thankfully, the stakes are not so high for my peers. They can gripe about the way their grueling workout routines have not yet rewarded them with the body they want, a body that society is supposedly brainwashing them into believing is beautiful\u2014and no one cares. We can wax neurotic and no one calls us out on it. No one refers to us as \u201cquerulous\u201d like the sickly, annoying side characters in 19th Century novels. I know this because I\u2019ve done my fair share of sobbing into the virtual void and no one said anything about it to my face. The only problem is that, while the behavior may now seem appropriate, whining will forever be a petty, unpleasant, primitive mode of expressing oneself. Even condensed and abbreviated for social media, it still grates. We will probably always be allowed to indulge our primal need to complain about lack of money, lack of sleep, bad weather, and bad traffic. Everyone experiences these. When it comes to the very specific grievances of our vastly different lives, however, there\u2019s no reason for us to expect anyone to be interested. Even if we were to catch people\u2019s attention with our incessant grumbling, we can\u2019t expect them to solve our problems for us. Crowdsourcing is not that effective.

It\u2019s maddening to be in a constant state of becoming. The situation begs itself to be shared. And when it is, we\u2019re relieved to see how we\u2019re all such amateurs. No one is even close to accomplishing a respectable level of self-mastery and isn\u2019t that great? Isn\u2019t growing up such an amusingly infinite process? No. Truthfully, it\u2019s not. Ineptitude is never amusing in its own right. When compared to maturity and success, it may be a joke or a cautionary tale. When everyone is a bungling wreck, though, there\u2019s no point in mentioning it. Yet we still mention it. We may cheerfully claim that nobody\u2019s perfect, but we still hold fast to a certain vision of perfection. Otherwise, there would be no need to comment on our shortcomings. The ideal person would still seem to be someone with composure, a self-controlled specimen of high esteem. Someone who never gets sick, never goes broke, never falters, never cries. That person may not exist, but we obviously still hope it\u2019s a state we can achieve. Why else would we whine when we\u2019re not healthy, happy, and self-possessed? Why bother making a note of every single sore throat? Every instant we are sloppy, unsuccessful attempts at sophisticated human beings? Young people still aspire to loftier places than they currently occupy, yet some of us are in the habit of publicly documenting the whole stumbling ascent as if such a story is supposed to be more inspiring than the biography of someone who actually made it to the summit. In truth, it\u2019s depressing to see, and especially to be, people who don\u2019t know what they are doing or can\u2019t get their act together. Whining is annoying, oblivious whining is worse. We all will do it at some point, of course. When we were children, parents could tell us to stop being insufferable sulks. The burden is on us now to ask one another kindly not to chronicle every little headache, break-up, binge, hangover, accident, snub, or frustration. We all have vices, we all have demons, the world is unfair, boo hoo. What makes our human experience interesting is not the fact that we all fail from time to time and will most certainly encounter a fatal obstacle eventually. The splendor of life instead lies in the possibility of triumph and greatness. Public displays of confidence carry more weight than confessions of clumsiness and crippling doubt.

It would be nice for Millenials to remember that and not crash the servers trying to testify to their incompetence.", "generated_text": "This piece is a thought-provoking reflection on the culture of constant complaining and self-pity that pervades social media, particularly among Millennials. The author argues that while complaining about everyday frustrations may have been a socially acceptable behavior in the past, especially during difficult times like the flu, it has become a normalized and even encouraged behavior in today's digital age.\n\nThe author critiques the tendency to whine about minor setbacks, such as being unwell, struggling with fitness goals, or experiencing disappointment, as a way to seek validation and connection with others. This behavior, while understandable, has become a form of entertainment for some, with people indulging in the \"amusingly infinite process\" of becoming grown-ups.\n\nHowever, the author also highlights that this kind of behavior can be alienating and disappointing to those around us, particularly those who have more confidence, success, and composure. In a society where people are constantly bombarded with curated highlights and achievements on social media, comparing oneself to others' successes can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.\n\nThe author's central argument is that it's precisely because we all experience failures and uncertainties that make our human experiences worthwhile. Instead of constantly complaining about our setbacks, we should strive to display confidence and resilience in the face of adversity. This is because true growth and self-improvement come from overcoming challenges and pushing ourselves beyond our limits, rather than just whining about not living up to an unrealistic ideal.\n\nThe tone of the", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.3116224765445565, "p": 5.432675487249128e-08, "detected_greenlist_number": 196, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9077238440513611, "Recall": 0.8797615170478821, "Accuracy": 0.8945000171661377}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9077238440513611, "Recall": 0.8797615170478821, "Accuracy": 0.8945000171661377}, "total_statistics": [2656.0, 2711.0, 270.0, 363.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2656.0, 2711.0, 270.0, 363.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 49}

The invasive plants, which were introduced by humans in the 1930s to stabilize certain areas of the dunes, have accelerated and spread rapidly, causing the native vegetation to disappear.\n\nThe Forest Service has acknowledged the ecological mistake and is now considering a habitat restoration program to push back against the invasive plants. However, some environmentalists and OHV users are skeptical about the effectiveness of this approach. OHV users argue that closing down illicit OHV trails will simply give more space to the invasive species, which could exacerbate the problem. They also point out the potential environmental harm of spraying pesticides and using bulldozers in sensitive habitats.\n\nMeanwhile, the Forest Service is exploring possible restoration options, such as plowing away parts of the foredune to dry out the wetlands. The agency is also under pressure to find funding for the restoration work, which may prove challenging.\n\nThe issue has brought together an unlikely alliance between OHV and environmental groups, who are now working together to push for a comprehensive restoration program.

Breaking down the steps can make it more manageable and actionable for webmasters:\n\n1. **Don't Panic and Wait**: It's essential to avoid overreacting and taking hasty decisions after a Google algorithm change. Waiting for about a month allows time for Google to make any necessary tweaks, giving you an idea of whether the algorithm change was temporary or a more significant shift.\n\n2. **Analyze Rankings and Adjust Strategy**: If your rankings still haven't recovered after a month, it's time to reassess your approach. Look at what's working on the search results pages and adjust your strategy to align with that. This could involve tweaking your pages, adjusting your content strategy, or improving technical aspects of your website.\n\n3. **Get Fresh Eyes and Feedback**: Don't underestimate the value of getting outside help and a fresh perspective on your website. Collaborating with an SEO expert who can take a step back and provide an unbiased opinion can help you identify areas that need improvement. Sometimes, you might miss subtle issues or opportunities for improvement due to your close proximity to the site.\n\nBy following these steps, webmasters can effectively navigate the complex landscape of Google algorithm changes and optimize their websites for long-term success.

This was highlighted during a presidential debate where Trump and Clinton exchanged heated questions and criticisms on the hacking and Russian interference in the election. Trump repeatedly seized on the WikiLeaks hack of John Podesta's email and encouraged his supporters to explore the trove of documents. \n\nThroughout the debate, Clinton pressed Trump to condemn Russia's actions, but he ultimately only acknowledged a broader condemnation of potential cyberattacks and espionage, refusing to specifically condemn Russia's involvement. U.S. officials have stated their confidence that Russia is behind these hacks, but Trump maintained he didn't personally know any details about the hacks and only acknowledged potential interference from any foreign agent. \n\nMeanwhile, other prominent Republicans have expressed concerns, with Senator Marco Rubio warning against crediting Russia for hacks targeting one party, anticipating they could potentially target the other party as well in the future. This debate highlights deep divisions and controversies in the lead-up to the presidential election. \n\nSome points to take home from this article include: \n\n- Kellyanne Conway confirmed that the Trump campaign feels comfortable using information stolen by Russians to harm Clinton's campaign.\n- Donald Trump repeatedly emphasized the hacked emails from the Clinton campaign during his campaign, even though he acknowledged he did not directly know the hackers.\n- Hillary Clinton requested specific condemnation from Trump regarding the hacking from Russia and", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.50333209967908, "p": 3.3448111130818248e-06, "detected_greenlist_number": 189, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9042444825172424, "Recall": 0.8918285369873047, "Accuracy": 0.8991666436195374}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9042444825172424, "Recall": 0.8918285369873047, "Accuracy": 0.8991666436195374}, "total_statistics": [2663.0, 2732.0, 282.0, 323.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2663.0, 2732.0, 282.0, 323.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 56}

Hi HT City Search, I am searching for an oven that my granny used. It could be placed directly over the gas stove. It baked as well as heated multiple dishes. There was an adjustable rack inside. Hi Vandana, such ovens were used long time back but still there are few places in the Capital that sell them.

I'm glad I have a few leads to share with you, but I think there was some confusion between your requests for the oven and the silk saris.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what I found for each item on your wish list:\n\n1. Traditional oven for baking and heating dishes directly over a gas stove with an adjustable rack: \n- As mentioned earlier, you have two possible options to look into: the Sadar Bazaar market in Central Delhi or the Wazirpur Industrial Area in North Delhi. Visit the Sadar Bazaar market, as it is likely to have vendors selling traditional stoves like the one your granny used. \n- If you wish to visit the Wazirpur Industrial Area, keep an eye out for shops selling utensils, kitchenware, or even antique items that may include a vintage stove like the one your granny had.\n\n2. Traditional Mulberry Silk Sarees to gift your wife from Assam: \n- You can visit the ongoing Surajkund Crafts Mela to find authentic Mulberry silk saris specifically from Assam. There's also a good mix of vendors offering local, cultural dresses for women like Assamese dresses.\n- If attending a craft fair in Surajkund seems like a lot of travel, consider checking out the Assam Emporium in Connaught Place for an even wider range of Mulberry Silk saris", "detection_result": {"z_score": 4.965212315030781, "p": 3.431297577183301e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 193, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8995543122291565, "Recall": 0.8708928227424622, "Accuracy": 0.8863333463668823}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8995543122291565, "Recall": 0.8708928227424622, "Accuracy": 0.8863333463668823}, "total_statistics": [2624.0, 2694.0, 293.0, 389.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2624.0, 2694.0, 293.0, 389.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 59}

In Colorado and Washington, medical marijuana measures passed, but one in Arizona was rejected. There were 10 questions on the ballot and seven passed.

Also turned down were Question 6 to allow a tax break on property that conserved water and Question 7 that would have imposed a sales tax on items purchased from local government stores. There was overwhelming approval for Question 5 to limit the length of the Legislature, which in 1995 and 1997, both lasted 169 days. Senate Majority Leader William Raggio, R-Reno, a leading proponent, said leadership has already set a timetable to conduct its business within the 120 day limit. There will be deadlines for each house to pass its bills, except in certain cases. And committee actions must be taken by certain dates. The 1997 session cost a record $15.5 million, and this is expected to reduce the cost several million dollars. Although opposed by most law enforcement officer, Question 9 on medical marijuana handily won passage 58-41 percent. But it must be approved again at the 2000 election before it is written into the Constitution. It is patterned after the California initiative, which has run into trouble from federal law enforcement officials.

Corbyn denied this claim, describing it as \"untrue\".\n\nSmith has also reported receiving death threats and claimed that the problem of abuse was not present before Corbyn's leadership win. He stated that while he had not been personally bullied by Corbyn, but believed that under his leadership, there has been a culture of bullying.\n\nIn response to the allegations of abuse, Corbyn told Sky News that he would like his colleagues to focus on political issues rather than personal attacks, but also criticized those making allegations against him for using \"language that's been used\".\n\nHowever, Corbyn's leadership has been criticized for failing to take adequate action against the bullying and abuse directed towards its members. Corbyn's refusal to take a strong stance against the bullying and allegations has fueled further criticism of his leadership.\n\nSome possible explanations for the situation include:\n\n- Corbyn's refusal to take a strong stance against bullying and abuse, which may have emboldened those carrying out the abuse.\n- The rise in popularity of Jeremy Corbyn, which", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.9259818304894547, "p": 4.318833797356536e-05, "detected_greenlist_number": 184, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9189750552177429, "Recall": 0.8802653551101685, "Accuracy": 0.9008333086967468}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9189750552177429, "Recall": 0.8802653551101685, "Accuracy": 0.9008333086967468}, "total_statistics": [2654.0, 2751.0, 234.0, 361.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2654.0, 2751.0, 234.0, 361.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 64}

But why do we celebrate Easter and why is it so late this year? Easter is only days away with many getting ready for some time off work and school thanks to the bank holiday in the UK. The holiday, which is celebrated across the world, will start with Good Friday on April 19 and end on Easter Monday on April 22. Then celebration means Britons can soon tuck into copious amounts of chocolate eggs - but do you know why Easter is being celebrated? Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament of the Bible, the event is said to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in roughly 30 AD. Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities, essentially because he claimed to be the \u201cSon of God\u201d, and was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate. Jesus\u2019 death by crucifixion, marked by the Christian holiday Good Friday and subsequent resurrection three days later is said to have been done to prove that he was the living son of God. Easter also concludes the \u201cPassion of Christ\u201d - a series of events and holidays that begins with Lent. Lent is a 40-day fasting period which comes before Easter in the Christian and is a time for reflection in Christian traditions as well as for preparations before the celebration of Easter begins. Lent ends of Holy Thursday, which celebrates Jesus\u2019 Last Supper with his 12 apostles. The Easter holiday in the UK begin on Good Friday on which Jesus\u2019 crucifixion is observed and end on Easter Sunday. Easter is a moveable celebration so it can be hard to keep up to date on when it starts. Easter falls on the first Sunday after the Full Moon date, based on mathematical calculations, that falls on or after March 21. In 325 AD the Council of Nicaea ruled Easter would be held on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. However, if a the Full Moon falls on a Sunday, then Passover begins on a Sunday, so Easter is then delayed by a week to make sure it still occurs after Passover. Easter can be celebrated at anytime between March 22 and April 25, and this year\u2019s holiday is coming towards the end. Easter Sunday in 2019 will fall on April 21, meaning Good Friday will be on April 19 and the Easter bank holiday on April 22.

The celebration of Easter is tied to the movement of the moon and the vernal equinox, as dictated by the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.\n\nThe reason why Easter falls on a different date each year is due to its calculation as a \"moveable feast.\" In other words, it is not set on a specific date in the Western calendar, but rather on the first Sunday after the full moon that occurs on or after the vernal equinox. This means that the date of Easter can fall anywhere between March 22 and April 25.\n\nTo prevent Easter from conflicting with the Jewish holiday of Passover, which is also a moveable feast, the Council of Nicaea ruled that if the full moon falls on a Sunday, the celebration of Passover would be delayed by one week. This means that, even if the full moon were to occur on a Sunday, the celebration of Easter would not occur on the same date as Passover, but would be one week later.\n\nIn 2019, the Easter holiday falls on the week of April 19, marking the date of Good Friday and the start of the Easter celebrations in the UK, with Easter Monday taking place on April 22.

What is hyped is all the negatives. Let me read the opening paragraph \u2019cause it\u2019s really all you need to get the idea of this piece. Again, Andrew Sullivan. It\u2019s in New York Magazine. \u201cEarlier this week, I went to a lecture given by Steven Pinker on his latest book, Enlightenment Now. I\u2019m a huge and longtime fan of Pinker\u2019s, and his book The Blank Slate was, for me, a revelation. [Pinker]\u2019s become a deep and important critic of the visceral hostility to nature and science now so sadly prevalent on the left and right, a defender of reason and the Enlightenment against the \u2018social justice\u2019 movements on campus, and his new book is a near-relentless defense of modernity. \u201cI sat there for an hour slowly being buried in a fast-accumulating snowdrift of irrefutable statistics showing [amazing] human progress: the decline of violence and war, the rise and rise of democracy, the astonishing gains against poverty of the last couple of decades, the rise of tolerance and erosion of cruelty, lengthening lifespans, revolutions in health, huge increases in safety, and on and on. It was one emphatic graph after another that bludgeoned my current depression into a kind of forced rational cheeriness.\u201d In other words, this guy Pinker had been accumulating data to show that \u2014 in a universal way all over the world \u2014 all of our problems are getting better. But how many of you when I said, \u201cThe decline of violence and war,\u201d responded, \u201cWait a minute! There is not any decline\u2026\u201d? That\u2019s your instinct reaction, because what\u2019s on your mind is in Parkland, and we\u2019ve been at war in Afghanistan for seemingly, what, 18 years? \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the war in the Middle East 18 years. What do you mean less war? What do you mean less violence?\u201d Well, statistically, worldwide war is happening much less \u2014 so is violence \u2014 according to the stats. But in your living experience, it\u2019s kind of contradictory because it doesn\u2019t seem so, but that\u2019s the point. After looking at the evidence of how much improvement in the areas of squalor of life, you kind of have to do a check and say, \u201cWait a minute. This doesn\u2019t\u2026 This doesn\u2019t jibe with how I feel. It doesn\u2019t jibe with what I think I\u2019m seeing.\u201d Here\u2019s the last sentence of the paragraph: \u201cThere were no real trade-offs here; our gloom is largely self-imposed; and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d Bingo! Now, that may sound like deep stuff, but let me tell you what that means. What that means is we have forgotten the human flourishing, we\u2019ve forgotten the goodness, we have forgotten the happiness, the contentment that comes from a common idea of morality. My word in this case for virtue, and a concept of morality that is based our nature. These two paragraphs to me are dynamite. In the first place, \u201cour gloom is largely self-imposed and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d I could not agree more! That\u2019s why I have often suggested, if you want to change your life turn off news for a week and just see. Just do it. Turn off the news, do not watch any news. Do not watch any cable news anywhere for a week! You can do it. Don\u2019t be afraid. You can do it. You can listen to me because I do not make people feel unhappy or fill them with doom or gloom. Quite the opposite. This program lifts people up, makes people laugh. You know, we\u2019ve got this new thing we\u2019re doing at RushLimbaugh.com where we are actively responding to people. We\u2019re inviting people to get in touch with us, listeners, members of the audience, who we then establish a video connection with and we interview them and find out what is it about the program they like. It\u2019s revealing some of the best stuff. And people who participate in this, you can find where to do it at RushLimbaugh.com, in exchange for their participation people are allowed to ask me any kind of question they want and I\u2019ll answer it somehow, some way, either here or on another video that we put on the website or whatever. It\u2019s a work in progress. But the things that we are learning, the questions people want to ask me are better than any I have been asked by anybody on TV, by far, both personal and professional. And they\u2019re a joy to deal with. I answered one of these questions on a video last week. I hope we\u2019re able to post it this week. I\u2019m making no guarantees \u2019cause it\u2019s a new project that we\u2019re just getting up and running. But it is fabulous to actually learn and meet those of you in this audience who are participating in this. And it\u2019s a video conference that we set up with you, if you pass our tests. Well, \u2019cause we can\u2019t do everybody, got some fun little tests. But the point is, you know, there\u2019s a common thing these people say. And I would not have even thought to mention this today had it not been for this paragraph of Andrew Sullivan\u2019s. There\u2019s a common, almost everybody that we\u2019ve talked to \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of them now \u2014 are saying one variation or another that this program lets them know every day it\u2019s okay, that things are okay. And that has so much meaning to people. And the people that we\u2019re interviewing are all ages. They are all religions. They are all orientations, sexual orientations, gender. The demographic spread is amazing. It\u2019s fabulous to learn and see those of you who are participating in our little program here. Well, it\u2019s actually gonna get very big. But this is why I have said turn off the news. It is the most negative, particularly if you\u2019re a Republican or conservative or Trump supporter, it can ruin you. It can ruin your day. It can destroy a good mood. It can destroy contentment. And it shouldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s what it does. And if you turn it off for a week, you will see exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Turn it off for a week, but don\u2019t stop listening here. We don\u2019t make you feel gloomy. We don\u2019t make you feel like everything\u2019s doom and gloom and the end is near or anything like that at all. Quite the opposite. And then the admission here that we\u2019ve lost a common virtue, we\u2019ve lost a common morality, we\u2019ve lost a common base that unites us, that binds us together. The world is better than ever. Why are we so miserable? Social media plays a role in this too. But I don\u2019t know that social media is the cause of it.

And the more you subject yourself to it by watching the news or the stuff they produce as entertainment programming, the more it\u2019s gonna affect you, when it need not. Because they\u2019re the ones at making things look as bad as they are when they really aren\u2019t.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "It\u2019s reported statistically, but it is never hyped. What is hyped is all the negatives. Let me read the opening paragraph \u2019cause it\u2019s really all you need to get the idea of this piece. Again, Andrew Sullivan. It\u2019s in New York Magazine. \u201cEarlier this week, I went to a lecture given by Steven Pinker on his latest book, Enlightenment Now. I\u2019m a huge and longtime fan of Pinker\u2019s, and his book The Blank Slate was, for me, a revelation. [Pinker]\u2019s become a deep and important critic of the visceral hostility to nature and science now so sadly prevalent on the left and right, a defender of reason and the Enlightenment against the \u2018social justice\u2019 movements on campus, and his new book is a near-relentless defense of modernity. \u201cI sat there for an hour slowly being buried in a fast-accumulating snowdrift of irrefutable statistics showing [amazing] human progress: the decline of violence and war, the rise and rise of democracy, the astonishing gains against poverty of the last couple of decades, the rise of tolerance and erosion of cruelty, lengthening lifespans, revolutions in health, huge increases in safety, and on and on. It was one emphatic graph after another that bludgeoned my current depression into a kind of forced rational cheeriness.\u201d In other words, this guy Pinker had been accumulating data to show that \u2014 in a universal way all over the world \u2014 all of our problems are getting better. But how many of you when I said, \u201cThe decline of violence and war,\u201d responded, \u201cWait a minute! There is not any decline\u2026\u201d? That\u2019s your instinct reaction, because what\u2019s on your mind is in Parkland, and we\u2019ve been at war in Afghanistan for seemingly, what, 18 years? \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the war in the Middle East 18 years. What do you mean less war? What do you mean less violence?\u201d Well, statistically, worldwide war is happening much less \u2014 so is violence \u2014 according to the stats. But in your living experience, it\u2019s kind of contradictory because it doesn\u2019t seem so, but that\u2019s the point. After looking at the evidence of how much improvement in the areas of squalor of life, you kind of have to do a check and say, \u201cWait a minute. This doesn\u2019t\u2026 This doesn\u2019t jibe with how I feel. It doesn\u2019t jibe with what I think I\u2019m seeing.\u201d Here\u2019s the last sentence of the paragraph: \u201cThere were no real trade-offs here; our gloom is largely self-imposed; and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d Bingo! Now, that may sound like deep stuff, but let me tell you what that means. What that means is we have forgotten the human flourishing, we\u2019ve forgotten the goodness, we have forgotten the happiness, the contentment that comes from a common idea of morality. My word in this case for virtue, and a concept of morality that is based our nature. These two paragraphs to me are dynamite. In the first place, \u201cour gloom is largely self-imposed and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d I could not agree more! That\u2019s why I have often suggested, if you want to change your life turn off news for a week and just see. Just do it. Turn off the news, do not watch any news. Do not watch any cable news anywhere for a week! You can do it. Don\u2019t be afraid. You can do it. You can listen to me because I do not make people feel unhappy or fill them with doom or gloom. Quite the opposite. This program lifts people up, makes people laugh. You know, we\u2019ve got this new thing we\u2019re doing at RushLimbaugh.com where we are actively responding to people. We\u2019re inviting people to get in touch with us, listeners, members of the audience, who we then establish a video connection with and we interview them and find out what is it about the program they like. It\u2019s revealing some of the best stuff. And people who participate in this, you can find where to do it at RushLimbaugh.com, in exchange for their participation people are allowed to ask me any kind of question they want and I\u2019ll answer it somehow, some way, either here or on another video that we put on the website or whatever. It\u2019s a work in progress. But the things that we are learning, the questions people want to ask me are better than any I have been asked by anybody on TV, by far, both personal and professional. And they\u2019re a joy to deal with. I answered one of these questions on a video last week. I hope we\u2019re able to post it this week. I\u2019m making no guarantees \u2019cause it\u2019s a new project that we\u2019re just getting up and running. But it is fabulous to actually learn and meet those of you in this audience who are participating in this. And it\u2019s a video conference that we set up with you, if you pass our tests. Well, \u2019cause we can\u2019t do everybody, got some fun little tests. But the point is, you know, there\u2019s a common thing these people say. And I would not have even thought to mention this today had it not been for this paragraph of Andrew Sullivan\u2019s. There\u2019s a common, almost everybody that we\u2019ve talked to \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of them now \u2014 are saying one variation or another that this program lets them know every day it\u2019s okay, that things are okay. And that has so much meaning to people. And the people that we\u2019re interviewing are all ages. They are all religions. They are all orientations, sexual orientations, gender. The demographic spread is amazing. It\u2019s fabulous to learn and see those of you who are participating in our little program here. Well, it\u2019s actually gonna get very big. But this is why I have said turn off the news. It is the most negative, particularly if you\u2019re a Republican or conservative or Trump supporter, it can ruin you. It can ruin your day. It can destroy a good mood. It can destroy contentment. And it shouldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s what it does. And if you turn it off for a week, you will see exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Turn it off for a week, but don\u2019t stop listening here. We don\u2019t make you feel gloomy. We don\u2019t make you feel like everything\u2019s doom and gloom and the end is near or anything like that at all. Quite the opposite. And then the admission here that we\u2019ve lost a common virtue, we\u2019ve lost a common morality, we\u2019ve lost a common base that unites us, that binds us together. The world is better than ever. Why are we so miserable? Social media plays a role in this too. But I don\u2019t know that social media is the cause of it. Social media just serves as a way to see it and to amplify it. And I don\u2019t think Trump hatred is hatred of Trump. I think it\u2019s hatred of all of us. If you think Trump vanished tomorrow that The hate would stop? No way. Their hate is never going to end. That\u2019s the point. And the more you subject yourself to it by watching the news or the stuff they produce as entertainment programming, the more it\u2019s gonna affect you, when it need not.

However, Sullivan highlights how the audience's initial reaction was one of incredulity and skepticism at these positive statistics. Even though statistically, globally there is a decrease in violence, war, poverty, and the rise of democracy, people are experiencing a different reality on a personal level, making it difficult to reconcile the two.\n\nSullivan points out that our negative emotions and perceptions of the world are often self-imposed and heavily influenced by our media and news diets, suggesting that the way we consume information can significantly impact our mood and outlook. He advocates turning off news for a week to break out of a cycle of negativity and pessimism, allowing us to reevaluate our perspective on life and appreciate the good in ourselves and the world around us.\n\nFurthermore, Sullivan expresses disappointment in the decline of shared values and common morality in society, stating that we've lost sight of what unites us. He also touches on the influence of social media in perpetuating negative emotions and amplifying the hate towards certain individuals and ideologies, and believes that social media serves more as a platform to disseminate it rather than being the primary cause of it.\n\nSullivan concludes his thoughts on this subject by sharing a unique program where he connects with and engages with his audience, revealing a more positive and optimistic side of people's thoughts", "detection_result": {"z_score": 6.119912853410033, "p": 4.681327547828573e-10, "detected_greenlist_number": 203, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.90364670753479, "Recall": 0.8964487314224243, "Accuracy": 0.8999999761581421}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.90364670753479, "Recall": 0.8964487314224243, "Accuracy": 0.8999999761581421}, "total_statistics": [2701.0, 2699.0, 288.0, 312.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2701.0, 2699.0, 288.0, 312.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 67}

Yemen is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis, and the country\u2019s children are bearing the brunt of the tragedy. Nearly 1.5 million children there are acutely malnourished, according to international aid organizations. Save the Children estimated that a third of all children under five in Yemen fall into this category. Of those, about 370,000 are said to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition \u2014 it means they are 10 times more likely to die than malnourished children because their immune system has been dramatically weakened. As that figure continues to rise, images like this are emerging from the country, where a civil war broke out last year. Despite some international attention, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The conflict has pushed the country to the brink of famine; in many remote villages, mothers themselves are too malnourished to feed their children. Majed Ayyash, a 21-month-old child who suffered from severe malnutrition, is one of the fortunate ones in the country's capital, Sanaa, because his family managed to get him to a hospital. But even when families manage to get their children medical help, the remaining doctors and nurses are forced to work with limited supplies and almost no equipment. A number of medical facilities in the country have been frequently targeted by airstrikes. Footage obtained by Save the Children \u2014 the UK-based humanitarian group has operated in the country since 1963 and supports 160 facilities there \u2014 and provided to BuzzFeed News shows children on ventilators, struggling even as they receive treatment in a Sanaa hospital. A full-blown civil war began in February last year after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee Sanaa. Since then, the Houthis have continuously clashed with Hadi, who is supported by local militia and tribespeople in the predominantly Sunni south of the country. Hadi says the Houthis are proxies for Iran, an allegation that Iran has denied. As a result, the Saudi-led coalition that has offered its support to Hadi has been engaged in airstrikes that have claimed thousands of lives, many of them civilians. Yemen, which imports 90% of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world before the outbreak of war, according to the Associated Press. Nearly 18 months into a Saudi-led blockade, the situation has become worse. This is 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod. He had acute malnutrition because his family was unable to afford food for him. Since the beginning of the war last year, the average cost of a food basket has gone up by 26%. Since April, the price has increased by 13%, according to a World Food Program Market Watch report in July. The situation has become so dire that according to Doctors Without Borders, it had to increase its staff's wages by up to 50% in some regions just so they could continue to buy food. In March, 10 out of 22 governorates in Yemen were considered on the brink of famine. Now, all but two are, according to a recent BBC report. Ali Mohammed al-Tawaari, a six-month-old boy, was being treated in Sanaa for acute malnutrition and other complications. \"If you look at his face, you can see that death is approaching,\" Ali's mother, Wadha, told Reuters, as they photographed her son in June last year. No one knows if Ali survived. In an interview with the BBC, Ashwaq Muharram, a Yemeni doctor, said that she was using her own money to buy medicine and food for her patients. \"The rich are now the middle class, the middle class are now the poor, and the poor are now starving,\" she said.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "A third of all the country's children under 5 are acutely malnourished.

As that figure continues to rise, images like this are emerging from the country, where a civil war broke out last year. Despite some international attention, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The conflict has pushed the country to the brink of famine; in many remote villages, mothers themselves are too malnourished to feed their children. Majed Ayyash, a 21-month-old child who suffered from severe malnutrition, is one of the fortunate ones in the country's capital, Sanaa, because his family managed to get him to a hospital. But even when families manage to get their children medical help, the remaining doctors and nurses are forced to work with limited supplies and almost no equipment. A number of medical facilities in the country have been frequently targeted by airstrikes. Footage obtained by Save the Children \u2014 the UK-based humanitarian group has operated in the country since 1963 and supports 160 facilities there \u2014 and provided to BuzzFeed News shows children on ventilators, struggling even as they receive treatment in a Sanaa hospital. A full-blown civil war began in February last year after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee Sanaa. Since then, the Houthis have continuously clashed with Hadi, who is supported by local militia and tribespeople in the predominantly Sunni south of the country. Hadi says the Houthis are proxies for Iran, an allegation that Iran has denied. As a result, the Saudi-led coalition that has offered its support to Hadi has been engaged in airstrikes that have claimed thousands of lives, many of them civilians. Yemen, which imports 90% of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world before the outbreak of war, according to the Associated Press. Nearly 18 months into a Saudi-led blockade, the situation has become worse. This is 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod. He had acute malnutrition because his family was unable to afford food for him. Since the beginning of the war last year, the average cost of a food basket has gone up by 26%. Since April, the price has increased by 13%, according to a World Food Program Market Watch report in July. The situation has become so dire that according to Doctors Without Borders, it had to increase its staff's wages by up to 50% in some regions just so they could continue to buy food. In March, 10 out of 22 governorates in Yemen were considered on the brink of famine. Now, all but two are, according to a recent BBC report. Ali Mohammed al-Tawaari, a six-month-old boy, was being treated in Sanaa for acute malnutrition and other complications. \"If you look at his face, you can see that death is approaching,\" Ali's mother, Wadha, told Reuters, as they photographed her son in June last year. No one knows if Ali survived. In an interview with the BBC, Ashwaq Muharram, a Yemeni doctor, said that she was using her own money to buy medicine and food for her patients. \"The rich are now the middle class, the middle class are now the poor, and the poor are now starving,\" she said.", "generated_text": "The situation in Yemen is catastrophic for its children. With a third of all children under 5 experiencing acute malnutrition, it is imperative that international aid efforts are increased, particularly those focused on the most vulnerable populations, such as severe acute malnutrition cases.\n\nThe conflict has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine, with many remote villages facing severe shortages of food, leading mothers to become malnourished or unable to feed their children. Hospitals are struggling to provide adequate care to children with severe malnutrition due to limited supplies and equipment. The situation has been exacerbated by repeated airstrikes targeting medical facilities, resulting in many lives lost or unaccounted for.\n\nThe economic burden of the conflict is also taking a toll on the population, with the average cost of a food basket increased by 26% since the beginning of the war and by 13% since April, according to the World Food Program Market Watch report. This makes it challenging for individuals, including healthcare professionals, to access basic necessities like food and medicine.\n\nThe personal stories shared highlight the desperation and trauma faced by families and healthcare providers. The image of Majed Ayyash, a 21-month-old boy who survived severe malnutrition, and 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod, who was unable to afford food, drive home the need for urgent support. The loss of Ali Mohammed al-Tawaari, a six-month-old boy from his mother's eyes and words underscore the risk of child mortality and the critical need for resources.\n\nIn", "detection_result": {"z_score": 2.5403411844343533, "p": 0.005537218838078339, "detected_greenlist_number": 172, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9242738485336304, "Recall": 0.8942790031433105, "Accuracy": 0.9108333587646484}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.9242738485336304, "Recall": 0.8942790031433105, "Accuracy": 0.9108333587646484}, "total_statistics": [2673.0, 2792.0, 219.0, 316.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2673.0, 2792.0, 219.0, 316.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 71}

THE hard times made it all the sweeter for Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon as he celebrated his 13th grand slam title. The Serbian defeated Kevin Anderson 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7/3) to win his fourth Wimbledon crown, but first grand slam title since the French Open in 2016, which proved to be a dramatic turning point in his career. Novak Djokovic, right, is congratulated by Kevin Anderson after the men's singles final (Picture: John Walton/PA Wire). From holding all four slam titles Djokovic lost motivation, form and confidence before being forced to take six months off at the end of last season when elbow problems struck. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk now and look back at it and be kind of grateful, but I really am grateful to go through these kind of mixed emotions, turbulence, as well mentally, moments of doubt and disappointment and frustration, anger. Djokovic returned to the tour at the Australian Open in January, but his elbow was still hurting and in February he was forced to accept he needed to undergo surgery. Coming back in Indian Wells only a few weeks later proved a mistake with Djokovic a shadow of the player and competitor who dominated the tour for long spells between 2011 and 2016. But, after splitting from coach Andre Agassi and reuniting with mentor Marian Vajda, Djokovic gradually began to look more like his old self. There were signs on clay, but it was not until this tournament, and especially in his epic semi-final victory over Rafael Nadal, that there became no doubt the real Djokovic was back. He said, after taking a now-trademark taste of Wimbledon\u2019s grass: \u201cI couldn\u2019t pick a better place in the tennis world to peak and to make a comeback. Wimbledon has been always a very special tournament to me. I dreamed of winning it when I was a seven-year-old boy. I made a lot of improvised Wimbledon trophies from different materials. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to compare this year\u2019s victory and trophy with any of the other three because they\u2019re all special. Wimbledon do not allow children under five to watch matches in Centre Court, but three-year-old Stefan was brought into Djokovic\u2019s box for the trophy ceremony and shouted excitedly as his father walked over to do a BBC interview. Anderson was playing in his second slam final in less than a year after losing to Rafael Nadal at the US Open last summer. The 32-year-old South African, a late bloomer as a grand slam challenger, is learning the same lesson as many of his contemporaries: if one of the big fish does not get you, another one probably will. Of the last 46 slams, all but eight have been won by Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer. A career-best victory over Federer in the quarter-finals followed by an epic semi-final against John Isner kept Anderson on court for nearly 11 hours so it was no surprise that he was not as his best to start with. But he made a real fight of it in the third set where he held five set points. Anderson, who will rise to a career-high of No 5 in the world rankings, said: \u201cIt was a tough start for me. You always have high hopes. \u201cI was hoping to draw on some previous experiences, playing at the US Open in the final, obviously playing Federer a couple days ago. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really find my form the way I wanted to. Of course, my body didn\u2019t feel great, but I was definitely quite nervous starting out the match. I tried my best to keep at it. \u201cI definitely felt much better in the third set. I thought I had quite a few opportunities to win that third set. Barry Davies said it had \u201cbeen a lot of fun\u201d as he brought his commentary career to an end at Wimbledon. The 80-year-old called the mixed doubles final featuring Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka before leaving the BBC\u2019s Centre Court booth for the last time. Davies worked at ITV before joining the BBC in 1969 and his voice became one of the most distinctive in sport. Davies covered a host of World Cups and Olympic Games while also being a lead commentator for many years at Wimbledon. He was joined by Australian Liz Smylie on his final job and, after the mixed doubles reached its conclusion and the trophy presentations had taken place, he offered his farewell. \u201cWe will miss you Barry,\u201d said Smylie, a former Wimbledon doubles champion. \u201cI will miss you too,\u201d said Davies. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger.

Jamal Campbell, 25, was charged with attempted first degree murder of a police officer, according to Cook County court records. The officer saw a Dodge Charger and a Cadillac driven by Campbell drag racing just after 2 a.m. in the David Estates neighborhood of Alsip, according to prosecutors and a statement from Alsip Police Chief Jay Miller. During a search for the vehicles, the officer pulled into a parking lot for an apartment building in the 4000 block of 115th Street in Chicago and found two people inside the Cadillac. The officer used his marked squad car, with its light activated, to block the Cadillac into the parking lot, prosecutors said. He and his partner then got out of the squad car and told Campbell and his passenger to raise their hands. Campbell then put the Cadillac into reverse, backed up slightly, and then accelerated forward toward the officer, prosecutors said. The officer stepped back and fired a shot at Campbell in an attempt to stop the Cadillac. Campbell \u201cbegan making multiple movements within the vehicle\u201d and the officer fired a second shot, which incapacitated him, according to court records. Campbell was shot twice in the shoulder and was given medical attention by the Alsip officers before paramedics arrived, authorities. He was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in serious condition. Prosecutors said the incident was captured on the squad car\u2019s camera and on surveillance video from the apartment complex. Both officers suffered \u201cminor injuries\u201d and were taken to a hospital as a precaution, Alsip police and Chicago police said. Chicago police investigated the shooting and crash.

NEWTOWN -- Greenridge residents, raise your glasses. Newtown has agreed to share its water with you. The Legislative Council on Wednesday evening authorized First Selectman Pat Llodra to sign a contract allowing a 12-inch water line to run from Newtown along Route 25 to Greenridge, a district of 229 homes in Brookfield. Last week, Brookfield authorized Bill Davidson, its first selectman, to sign the contract. Greenridge's water is contaminated with radiation particles called radionuclides, which are possible carcinogens, said James Rice, the attorney representing Newtown in the matter. Radionuclides includes uranium, radon, and radium, said Marty Handshy, a water consultant for Brookfield's Board of Selectmen. The contract says United Water Co. will not serve Brookfield customers outside of the Greenridge area for three years. The water main will also serve residents of the borough section of Newtown, Rice said. About three years ago, the state approved United Water Co. extending a water line to the Greenridge area, Davidson said last week. The water company planned to do so by diverting water from the Pootatuck aquifer, Newtown's sole water source, Llodra said. She added that her reaction was \"How dare they think they can come to Newtown and take our water?\" Newtown was not invited to participate in the initial discussions between the state and United Water Co., Llodra said. Eventually she and other town officials and lawyers representing the town halted the process until an agreement could be reached, she said. United Water began construction of the water line May 25, 2010, according to the contract, and on June 1, 2010, the Department of Public Utility Control Commissioner ordered that construction cease. The town of Newtown, the borough section of Newtown and the town of Brookfield intervened to protect the interests of their respective citizens, and, in Newtown's case, the Pootatuck Aquifer, the contract says. The town of Newtown has been negotiating with United Water Co. and Brookfield for about seven months now to add stipulations to construction of the line, Llodra said. Rice said if the towns had not reached an agreement, United Water would have flowed the water line without any restrictions, and Newtown would have had to appeal in state Superior Court. Some of Llodra's concerns were that there was no diversion process executed and it was not clear what effect the water line would have on Newtown wells and the Pootatuck Aquifer, she said. The agreement allows United Water to construct the water line project named Newtown Greenridge Interconnection Improvements. However, for three years the line may not serve Brookfield customers living outside the Greenridge area unless there is an emergency, according to the contract. To expand its service area after that time, the company must conduct a study of the Pootatuck Aquifer and Pootatuck River and/or other potential sources of water to show that it Newtown water sources would not be harmed. The study will assist water utility planning in compliance with current and future regulations of the state, and will be used in discussions with Newtown and Brookfield, the contract says. The study could take up to 18 months and United Water will decide when it starts, the contract says. Handshy said the state Department of Public Utility Control in New Britain will rule on the agreement in the near future.

While the Church of the Holy Sepulchre has faced challenges due to the disagreements among the Christian denominations, physical fights and violent clashes between them are rare and usually not violent in nature, with participants typically resorting to verbal disputes and the occasional shoving match rather than full-blown combat. The situation can also lead to tense situations but no major fights in recorded history.\n\nIt is also essential to note that the article mentions the \"Queensberry Rules,\" referring to the set of standardized rules in pugilism (boxing) developed in England, likely to be a satirical commentary on what the brawling parties have grasped in terms of sportsmanship and fair play, especially compared to rugby, which has been mentioned. The reference to Rugby Union is likely intended to poke fun at how these Christian groups can benefit from adopting a well-organized, fair sport that emphasizes teamwork and mutual respect.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the suggestion made to the Armenian monks of reverting to the rules of Rugby Union, rather than boxing, could be seen as a light-hearted, yet somewhat patronizing, attempt to 'teach these groups discipline and sportsmanship through the more structured nature of rugby.'

It started as an idea to promote a common European culture and was conceived by a Danish NGO. \u201cIf we Europeans want to step back from just the economy \u2013 coal, metals, and fish \u2013 and to direct ourselves towards culture, we have to take the leadership of Europe into our own hands,\u201d said Jeppe Marsling, the founder and president of the EU song book project. The first edition of the European song book will be released on Europe Day on May 9, 2019. It will contain 162 songs in the local languages of the participating countries and in English. Any profit will be used to finance a second issue that will translate all the songs into the 24 EU languages, so that everyone, whether or not they know English, can sing and comprehend all the lyrics. The songs are sorted into the following six categories: love songs, nature and seasons, freedom and peace, folk and traditional songs, songs of faith and children\u2019s songs. Since May 2015, more than 26,000 people from 15-member states have voted on the six songs, one for each category, which will represent them. Greece just finished voting, and Cyprus is the next on the list to cast its votes. After that, the project will be extended to Portugal, Belgium and Malta, where students, teachers and members of choirs have chosen six songs for each category of their musical tradition prior to opening up the choice to the public. To prepare the Cyprus vote, students and staff of the music academy ARTE have shortlisted 46 Cypriot songs. http://www.eu-songbook.org.Voting is conducted in 24 languages \u2013 including Greek.", "generated_text": "Here are some key points from the article about the EU-wide song book project:\n\n1.

At the Central Police Station, located a few hundred meters from the Gran Place, in the very center of Brussels, dozens of off-duty police both in uniform and plainclothes could be seen reporting for emergency duty, many carrying automatic weapons. A squad of Belgian army members known as para-commandos also deployed and began patrolling various areas in the city center in full combat gear. Tuesday\u2019s attack came after a week of tensions throughout the Belgian capital as security forces closed in on Salah Abdeslam, believed by French and Belgian investigators to be the last surviving member of the ISIS cell that carried out the Paris attacks that killed more than 130 people and wounded hundreds more in a multi-pronged attack on the French capital last year. A raid in Brussels' Forrest neighborhood last Tuesday killed an Algerian with suspected ISIS ties, but Abdeslam was believed to have escaped back to his childhood haunt of Molenbeek, a largely Muslim immigrant neighborhood just outside central Brussels. Using a combination of electronic tracking of mobile phones and what investigators say was human intelligence, according to local media reports and terror analysts, security forces cornered, wounded, and arrested Abdesalm last Friday. Belgian authorities said early Tuesday afternoon that a massive manhunt was underway in Brussels for individuals they believe were linked to Tuesday's attacks.

The primary focus was on blocking new comments on Justin Bieber's videos, but other random videos were also affected.\n\nThe malware researcher, Chris Boyd, advised users to steer clear of the affected areas until a fix was implemented. However, he was more concerned about the misinformation and alarmist reporting that spread quickly online, rather than the actual attack itself. This highlights the issue of sensationalism and the potential for spreading misinformation on the internet.\n\nThe fact that the attack was not particularly sophisticated, but the potential for abuse and exploitation by malicious actors if discovered by a professional outfit is a warning of a broader issue. It emphasizes the importance of addressing vulnerabilities quickly and the need for responsible reporting and communication to prevent unnecessary fear or alarm. The phenomenon described by Boyd echoes the concept of \"Chinese whispers,\" where misinformation can spread rapidly and obscure facts through unverified channels. As the article suggests, awareness of the actual situation and clear communication are essential to minimizing the impact of such vulnerabilities and attacks. Additionally, Boyd's caution against spreading alarmist reports highlights the value of a nuanced understanding of technology and its vulnerabilities, allowing for more informed discussions.

Ghost Recon Future Soldier is set to drop on May 22, and much of the buzz surrounding the new game has involved the Gunsmith system, whereby players can customize their own unique weapons. We had a chance to talk Gunsmith with Michael, as well as hear about what&apos;s in his personal gun collection. How many options are there for weapons customization in GRFS? There are 52 guns in the game, each with up to 10 points of customization. There are 20 million plus possible combinations that the user can choose from. What are some of the real weapons that have inspired you in developing GRFS? All the weapons in the game are either based on real firearms or inspired by real firearms. In the event we get our hands on the actual gun, we use that information about recoil impulses, muzzle climb, maneuverability, etc., and try to incorporate that into the weapon design in the game. What are some of the highlights of your personal collection? My personal favorite right now is a bolt action rifle that I just rebuilt from the ground up. It&apos;s nothing special, but knowing that I took the rifle from a pile of parts to a completed gun capable of shooting accurately 800 yards out is pretty gratifying. What&apos;s your favorite Ghost Recon Future Soldier feature? Call me biased, but I would have to say Gunsmith is my favorite feature. I love having the ability to customize my weapons according to my personal preferences and play style. My favorite map has to be Alpha, which is inspired by the location of the Ghost Recon Alpha short film. For me, the map size is perfect for 6 vs. 6, and the multiple elevation levels and flanking routes are great for my play style.

This feature affects guns that the actual guns you see would have.\n- In Michael Climer's personal collection, there's a restoredbolt-action rifle that can shoot accurately over 800 yards from scratch. This is just for him and isn't for the public to see. The bolt action rifle demonstrates Michael's skill for taking parts of broken guns together as one and putting in quality control checks and tests to get things working right. His enthusiasm is evident for taking a pile of disorganized parts, and putting them together with some TLC and testing, in the end turning out functional piece of hardware that works to the best of his capabilities.

This decision comes after leading exchanges in India, including BSE and NSE, announced plans to curb licensing agreements and stop offering live prices to international exchanges. The SGX will list new successors to its Nifty derivatives before the licence agreement expires, providing market participants with continued access to the Indian capital markets.\n\nThe decision is seen as an effort by SGX to maintain its position as a major player in the derivatives market, particularly after the launch of single-stock futures in India last year, which has led concerns about liquidity moving out of the country.\n\nTo facilitate more participation from international market participants, SGX is working with NSE to develop a link that will allow trading on the NSE's International Exchange (NSE IFSC Limited) in Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) city.

While the result of the learning process is not to be dismissed, it is quite simply the joy of the learning journey that motivates Learners -- the process of learning is not the means to an end, but the end itself. It isn\u2019t necessarily the usefulness of the information that excites those with Learner talents; that is more of a hallmark of Input. It\u2019s taking a class, signing up for a webinar series, reading a series of articles that delve deeply into a topic, getting an advanced degree -- these are activities that light up Learners. People high in Learner are inquisitive, but this is not typically expressed in asking a lot of random questions about any or all topics. Rather, satisfying the inquisitive itch for a Learner typically takes the form of deep and thorough exploration through individual research online or in the library, taking a class, or spending regular time with a subject matter expert.

While the result of the learning process is not to be dismissed, it is quite simply the joy of the learning journey that motivates Learners -- the process of learning is not the means to an end, but the end itself. It isn\u2019t necessarily the usefulness of the information that excites those with Learner talents; that is more of a hallmark of Input. It\u2019s taking a class, signing up for a webinar series, reading a series of articles that delve deeply into a topic, getting an advanced degree -- these are activities that light up Learners. People high in Learner are inquisitive, but this is not typically expressed in asking a lot of random questions about any or all topics. Rather, satisfying the inquisitive itch for a Learner typically takes the form of deep and thorough exploration through individual research online or in the library, taking a class, or spending regular time with a subject matter expert.

People high in Learner value learning as an end in itself and often get excited about deep exploration and discovery. They tend to be inquisitive and enjoy exploring topics of interest, but not necessarily in groups or with others. \n\n**Motivators for Learning** \n- Individuals who score high on the Learner theme often enjoy the journey of learning and are motivated by the process itself, even if the subject matter is not of direct utility. They enjoy the journey of discovery, the thrill of finding answers, or understanding new concepts. The pursuit of learning is an end in itself and brings a sense of satisfaction or pleasure that goes beyond a sense of external reward. This is why individuals with a high Learner quotient tend to be avid students and lifelong learners who are drawn to the intellectual pursuit of learning for its own value. In some cases, the end goal might be less important than the process, and the outcome \u2013 while beneficial in itself \u2013 remains secondary or incidental to their personal satisfaction with learning as a process. \n\n**Strengths and Value**\n- They often contribute to teams through providing research and expertise that may come from a lifelong process of learning to deepen expertise in their particular field and help others benefit from it. When a Learner contributes this way \u2013 providing knowledge that is gained from extensive personal experience, deep study and exploration through personal research \u2013 the organization often benefits with", "detection_result": {"z_score": 7.851963660978909, "p": 1.9984014443252818e-15, "detected_greenlist_number": 218, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.924983024597168, "Recall": 0.9041141271591187, "Accuracy": 0.9150000214576721}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.924983024597168, "Recall": 0.9041141271591187, "Accuracy": 0.9150000214576721}, "total_statistics": [2725.0, 2765.0, 221.0, 289.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2725.0, 2765.0, 221.0, 289.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 98}

Massachusetts businesses, looking to cut their health care costs, are teaming up on a new initiative aimed at sharply cutting the number of people who seek care in hospital emergency rooms when they could be treated elsewhere. Employer groups representing thousands of businesses across the state said Wednesday that they plan to reduce avoidable emergency room visits by 20 percent over the next two years, saving $100 million. More than 40 percent of emergency room visits \u2014 or about 1 million a year \u2014 are thought to be avoidable, according to state data. Many of these patients show up at hospitals with minor infections, sore throats, skin rashes, allergies, and back pain. Such visits can add to wait times in emergency rooms and drive up costs. Hospitals are many times more expensive than doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care clinics, and retail clinics. Employers said they will tackle the issue by better educating their workers about the most appropriate places to get health care, and by designing insurance plans that discourage unnecessary trips to the emergency room. They have not yet detailed what these incentives might be, but the incentives could include lower out-of-pocket costs for visiting a primary-care doctor, higher costs for visiting a hospital \u2014 or both. The initiative represents the first time that so many Massachusetts employers have coalesced around a particular driver of health care spending. It has the support of 20 business groups including Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and Retailers Association of Massachusetts. Hospitals, insurers, and the state Health Policy Commission \u2014 which tracks health spending \u2014 also back the effort. Millions of Massachusetts residents get health insurance through work, with their employers paying a significant portion of those costs. Business owners frequently complain that rising health care costs hamper their ability to hire and grow. State officials and academics have long tracked the inappropriate use of emergency rooms. But Massachusetts has not made progress in curbing unnecessary emergency room visits in at least five years, according to the Health Policy Commission \u2014 even though the vast majority of state residents have health insurance, and many have access to new walk-in clinics and telehealth services that provide alternatives to hospital care. \u201cUnfortunately, for many individuals, the emergency department becomes their main source of primary care,\u201d said David Seltz, executive director of the Health Policy Commission. The Massachusetts College of Emergency Physicians supports the business community\u2019s effort, but objects to estimates that peg avoidable emergency room visits at more than 40 percent. The group prefers a much lower estimate \u2014 3.3 percent \u2014 which was calculated using a much narrower definition. Dr. Scott Weiner, president of the emergency physicians group, noted that it\u2019s much easier to call a visit \u201cavoidable\u201d after the fact. A patient who thinks he is suffering a heart attack may actually have severe heartburn, for example, but he wouldn\u2019t know that until he sees a physician, Weiner noted. Backers of the initiative said they will be careful not to make emergency room visits so expensive that they deter people from going to the hospital when they may be seriously ill. Eileen McAnneny, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said employer groups will create a toolkit that explains \u201cin plain English\u201d the different locations where their workers can get medical care, and the different costs of those sites. \u201cI think this is the start of something big,\u201d McAnneny said of the initiative.
