DLP technology, however, is known for offering relatively high contrast ratios and good color accuracy for its class.\n\n3. **Resolution and pixel count**: The BenQ MX525 boasts an XGA (1024 by 768) resolution, which indicates that the projector will be capable of producing images in this resolution range with reasonable detail and clarity. For a budget projector, XGA resolution is often sufficient, and it's great that the XGA format supports true parallel pixels, which can help maintain pixel density even when the projector is not producing as high a brightness level as it could in very dim conditions.\n\n4. **Zoom capability**: As you've mentioned, the projector can be zoomed through the zoom ring located behind the lens, making it a good option for different room sizes depending on how big the space needs to", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.427092530382482, "p": 2.8639718707701434e-08, "detected_greenlist_number": 197, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8939241170883179, "Recall": 0.8844237923622131, "Accuracy": 0.8893333077430725}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8939241170883179, "Recall": 0.8844237923622131, "Accuracy": 0.8893333077430725}, "total_statistics": [2663.0, 2673.0, 316.0, 348.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2663.0, 2673.0, 316.0, 348.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 1}

Scientists are perfecting techniques for rebuilding tattered wetlands, creating custom configurations for individual shorelines. Governments and disaster planners are starting to give more consideration to living shorelines, and money to restore them is rising. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes. After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty. What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases. Gittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea. In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break. In recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine\u2019s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of \u201cgreen\u201d coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses. Around the time that Hurricane Irene was barreling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. \u201cA lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,\u201d Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and mangroves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory. The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012. Working with Risk Management Solutions, a leading risk-modeling firm, the scientists showed that wetlands prevented $625 million of flood damage from the storm, which was surprising given that the coasts in the region had already lost 60 to 90 percent of their protective wetlands over time. In areas that flooded, the few remaining wetlands lowered flood damage by 11 percent on average. As important was the ability to buffer garden-variety floods: in one local study, properties behind marshes suffered 16 percent less annual flood damage than properties that had lost their marshes. \u201cThat\u2019s well within the range for which you could expect [insurance] premium reductions,\u201d Beck points out. He and his partners then turned their economic and risk-management models on the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, which is regularly battered by big storms. They did an exhaustive analysis of the annual expected benefits and costs of all types of infrastructure. The team estimated that the coast would suffer $134 billion of losses over 20 years if no preventive measures were taken. Elevating homes could prevent $39.4 billion of those losses, but it is incredibly expensive. At an average of $83,300 per house, it would cost $54 billion to prevent that $39 billion in damages. The six-meter-high dikes being built in Louisiana were a worse option; at $33,000 per meter, they were an absurdly expensive way to protect a relatively limited amount of property, returning just $1 in savings for every $4 of expense. Smaller levees built on land in front of many low-lying coastal communities prevented much more damage for almost the same cost. In terms of bang for the buck, sandbags were the best investment, saving $8.4 billion of damages for a mere $0.84 billion in expense. Natural defenses ranked high as well. Wetlands restoration, which could prevent $18.2 billion of losses, would cost just $2 billion. Oyster-reef restoration could prevent $9.7 billion in losses for $1.3 billion. Barrier island restoration offered $5.9 billion of prevention for $1.2 billion. And \u201cbeach nourishment\u201d (replenishing depleted beaches with sand dredged from the seafloor) in the eastern Gulf could save $9.3 billion for $5.5 billion. Overall, the research found that $57.4 of the $134 billion could be prevented cost-effectively, almost all of it through green infrastructure. Cost-effective restoration may be tricky on long, sandy coasts, too. Beaches and barrier islands are by nature transient. Planting grasses to rebuild dunes can help keep beaches in place but only temporarily in many cases. At some point, residents will have to move back from the receding shoreline. One reason living shorelines are becoming an economically viable approach for coastal defense is that researchers and municipalities are getting better at rebuilding them. Early marsh-restoration designs, which followed forestry science and gave each plant plenty of space to avoid competition, were actually counterproductive. It turns out that in bare mudflats, \u201cwhen marsh plants are together, they share oxygen, so their growth rate is twice as high,\u201d says Brian Silliman, an ecologist at Duke University. Root them in large clumps, and the growth rate of each individual plant can triple. Add blue crabs, which eat the snails that eat the salt-marsh grasses, and the plants do even better. Scientists are also finding that marshes do best when they have a protective sill\u2014a linear berm that fronts the seaside edge of the grass and stands. Made of hard material such as shell, stone or concrete, its height and position are typically chosen so that water covers it at high tide, but it is exposed during low tide. The sill takes the brunt of wave energy but also traps sediment behind it, allowing the grass to thrive and marsh floor to retain its elevation or even rise. Almost any hard material can make a successful sill. Large shoreline-stabilization projects use big boulders or stackable concrete blocks, a practice that has been criticized by some experts who say that these structures are living shorelines in name only. But many lower-profile restorations integrate sills more seamlessly into the natural habitat. In the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions, marshes historically possessed a natural sill in the form of an intertidal oyster reef. Many of those reefs were overharvested long ago, ruining the sill and exposing the marshes to erosion. In these warm, oyster-friendly waters, new sills can be formed by placing a hard substrate along the low-tide line at the front edge of the marsh for baby oysters to set on. Some sites with lots of wave action have used small, hollow concrete structures or plastic mesh \u201conion bags\u201d stuffed with shell and lashed together. When successful, these artificial materials are quickly covered by oysters and disappear into the interstices of the growing reef. But the concrete often remains visible for years, and the bags have been criticized for breaking and scattering plastic through the environment. Gittman and Beck both stress the need to tailor living shorelines to local conditions. One reason oyster restoration is so cost-effective in the Gulf and the Southeast is because there have been plentiful wild oysters to seed new reefs with babies. That is not the case in most of the country. Chesapeake Bay, for example, was long the poster child for futile oyster restoration. Oyster populations in the bay had fallen to less than 1 percent of historical norms, and decades of effort and tens of millions of dollars barely budged the needle. Beck extends that lesson to coral reefs, the most underappreciated of natural defenses. \u201cCoral reefs are the single most effective ecosystem for flood-risk reduction,\u201d he says. Corals, which have evolved to take a daily pounding that would destroy most other living things, form natural seawalls exactly where you want them\u2014just offshore, in front of resorts, beach towns, coastal roads and other pricey assets. When healthy, they make remarkably effective breakwaters, reducing wave energy up to 97 percent. They are also affordable: reef restoration averages about $1,300 per meter versus $20,000 for artificial breakwater construction. The insurance industry\u2019s assessment for mitigating risk from climate change in the Caribbean found that reviving reefs and mangroves was an order of magnitude more cost-effective than seawalls or breakwaters. Even though reefs do not line a lot of shorefronts, the annual expected benefits they generate are significant\u2014more than $100 million a year in the U.S. alone and more than $400 million a year each in Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cuba. Coastal restoration may finally be getting the attention it deserves. \u201cThings are really beginning to change,\u201d Beck says. The Army Corps, which for decades has favored hardscape solutions, has launched an Engineering With Nature initiative\u2014something many planners thought they would never see. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made living shorelines a centerpiece of its coastal-resilience blueprint. Hundreds of projects have been completed or are underway around the country, ranging from shoreline stabilizations in Maryland to bulkhead removal in Puget Sound. Most are small, community-based efforts, but larger ventures are becoming more common. Stimulus funding that flowed after the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased the size of some projects significantly. Kilometers of oyster-reef projects now line Alabama, Texas and Louisiana. The flagship is Coffee Island, off the Alabama coast. The shoreline had receded up to 100 meters. The Nature Conservancy placed a three-kilometer-long line of shell bags and concrete balls about 30 meters offshore, paralleling the island. The reef immediately blocked wave energy, allowing the marsh to rebuild. Within two years approximately 200 baby oysters per square meter had colonized the structure, covering it and attracting fish, crabs and birds. Yet where there is a will\u2014and local money\u2014there is a way. The San Francisco Bay Clean Water, Pollution Prevention, and Habitat Restoration Measure, passed by Bay Area voters in 2016, raises $25 million a year for 20 years through a parcel tax. That $500 million will be used to build 40,000 hectares of wetlands\u2014the largest shoreline restoration undertaken in the U.S.\u2014using various techniques. The most novel is horizontal levees. Instead of a high, narrow mound that lines the shore, horizontal levees are broad mudflats, marshes and grasslands that gradually rise from the water\u2019s edge, sometimes for hundreds of meters back onto the land. They are graded with vast amounts of earth (often repurposed from building projects) and planted with starter plugs. They can be lower and 40 percent less costly than a traditional levee because the breadth absorbs floodwater. The configuration also gives marsh communities space to retreat as seas rise. Another encouraging sign is the Living Shorelines Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Frank Pallone, whose New Jersey district was devastated by Superstorm Sandy. The bill would designate $20 million in grants a year to living-shoreline work. A Senate version was introduced by Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California. Their prospects in the current Congress were uncertain at press time, but their existence shows that living shorelines are gaining ground. North Carolina\u2019s Coastal Resources Commission recently approved a new process that will make it as easy to obtain a living-shoreline permit as that for a bulkhead. Maryland has an even stronger law in place, requiring a homeowner to prove why a bulkhead is needed instead of a natural shoreline. Other states may follow these leads. The most promising indication of all may be the 2018 agreement made by the Nature Conservancy, the reinsurance industry and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo to create a trust fund to protect the Mesoamerican Reef, off the coast of Canc\u00fan and Puerto Morelos. The deal will include the first insurance policy ever taken out on a natural ecosystem. If the reef is damaged by a storm, insurance funds are released to rebuild its natural capital. For living shorelines to become an important part of any long-term coastal defense plan, policy makers in government, insurance and development will have to start improving and installing them before bad storms hit\u2014and funding the next round of projects through postdisaster spending afterward. That requires good science and good economic numbers\u2014which now exist\u2014as well as good proof in the form of demonstration projects, which are increasingly common. The first significant examples of postdisaster spending on natural infrastructure could occur as FEMA and other agencies look to spend more than $100 billion in recovery funds from recent hurricanes. Although FEMA\u2019s traditional hazard-mitigation investments have focused on tactics such as buying out damaged coastal homes or elevating them, the agency has adjusted its new \u201cbenefit-cost analysis\u201d policy to favor investment in natural infrastructure. Beck expects this change in emphasis to result in federally funded projects of unprecedented scope in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. Other large-scale development may soon follow worldwide as governments, disaster-risk managers, businesses, banks and insurers look to mitigate their risk exposure as cost-effectively as possible. When that happens, it will mark a moment when society realizes nature is not a luxury. It is the future.

Marshes with and without Sills Protect Estuarine Shorelines from Erosion Better Than Bulkheads during a Category 1 Hurricane. Rachel K.

World Bank, January 2016.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "Surprising data show that in many places marshes protect shorelines better than walls and are cheaper to construct. Scientists are perfecting techniques for rebuilding tattered wetlands, creating custom configurations for individual shorelines. Governments and disaster planners are starting to give more consideration to living shorelines, and money to restore them is rising. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes. After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty. What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases. Gittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea. In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break. In recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine\u2019s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk. Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of \u201cgreen\u201d coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses. Around the time that Hurricane Irene was barreling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. \u201cA lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,\u201d Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and mangroves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory. The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012. Working with Risk Management Solutions, a leading risk-modeling firm, the scientists showed that wetlands prevented $625 million of flood damage from the storm, which was surprising given that the coasts in the region had already lost 60 to 90 percent of their protective wetlands over time.

NZRU high performance referee manager Lyndon Bray said Jackson\u2019s signing as a full-time professional referee would add depth and provide a new dimension to New Zealand\u2019s professional pool of rugby referees. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Glen Jackson has chosen refereeing as the next step in his professional rugby career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that professional players at Glen\u2019s level make the move into refereeing but his skills as a player can only enhance his ability as a referee. Jackson, who has played for Bay of Plenty, the Chiefs, New Zealand Maori and the New Zealand Barbarians, is looking forward to the new challenge.", "generated_text": "Glen Jackson, the Saracens fly-half, has joined the ranks of New Zealand's professional referees after being granted special leave to attend a New Zealand Referees training camp in Auckland. He will participate in the NZRU Referee Academy Training programme to prepare for a potential assignment in the 2010 Heartland Championship, a second-tier provincial competition in New Zealand rugby. Jackson is currently contracted at English Premiership club Saracens but will now focus on developing his refereeing skills as a full-time professional with the goal of becoming a high-level referee. His inclusion in New Zealand's rugby referee pathway is seen as a significant development, bringing expertise and new skills to the team while also providing depth and diversity in their professional pool of referees. It appears that Jackson's skills as a player are being leveraged to enhance his refereeing abilities, and he is eager to take on the challenge. The development of this relationship and Jackson's involvement in the NZRU Referee Academy Training programme suggests an increasing emphasis on developing and promoting rugby refereeing in New Zealand and elsewhere. His inclusion also signals the growing interest in rugby refereeing as both a player and officiating career path for those involved, offering opportunities for growth and professional expression in both roles. With his experience playing for multiple franchises across New Zealand, Jackson brings a wealth of knowledge and insight into the game that he is likely to share with the NZRU Referees community, enhancing its overall expertise and depth.

Tiger Woods has done it again. Woods is a Masters champion for the fifth time in his illustrious, storied career. After an 11-year drought, golf's most polarizing and popular figure has added another major to his dossier, outlasting a star-studded leaderboard on Sunday by posting a final round 2-under 70 to win the 2019 Masters. It's his first major win since the 2008 U.S. Open, 15th of his career and first at Augusta National since 2005. With five green jackets now in his Augusta locker, Woods is second all-time at the pristine course behind only Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Woods began the day T2 and in the final pairing for the first time since 2007, but he sat two strokes off leader Francesco Molinari, who had been steady all week. Molinari led throughout much of the day, in fact, until double-bogeys on No. 12 and No. 15 opened a small window for Tiger to pounce -- and pounce he did. Woods birdied the par-5 13th hole and par-5 15th for the third time this week, then birdied the par-3 16th with a near-hole-in-one. He walked up to No. 17 with a two-stroke lead on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, and when Koepka missed a birdie putt on 18 that would have put pressure on Woods, Tiger was able to clinch it with a bogey on the final hole. \"I was just trying to plod my way around the golf course all day, then all of a sudden I had the lead, and coming up 18, it was just trying to make a 5,\" said Woods. \"When I tapped the putt in, I don't know what I did, but I know I screamed. And then I was just looking for Joey. I shook the guys' hands and then found Joey, and it was a pretty big embrace. To have my kids there, it's come full circle. My dad was here in 1997 and now i'm the dad with two kids there.\" Woods becomes a five-time Masters winner on Sunday, which stands alone as the second-most in the sport's history ahead of Arnold Palmer. Only Jack Nicklaus, who won six, has more. The victory marks Woods' first at Augusta since 2005, when he capped an incredible decade of dominance at the event he also won in 1997, 2000 and 2001. \"It's overwhelming,\" said Woods of winning for a fifth time. \"I think just because of what has transpired, and last year i was just very lucky to be playing again. The previous dinner, the champions dinner, I was really struggling and missed a couple years of not playing this great tournament. To now be the champion, 22 years between wins is a long time. But it's just unreal for me to experience this. My mom was here, she was there in 97 as well. So I just couldn't be more happy and more excited and i'm kind of at a loss for words, really.\" Woods' fourth and final round was a roller coaster, much like the rest of the field. He began with consecutive pars before birdie-bogey-bogey on 3, 4 and 5. In his final four holes on the first nine, he tapped in two birdies to stay on pace with the leaders. His second nine was bookended by bogeys, but in between, he played the seven holes at 3-under, led by consecutive birdies on 15 and 16. Following the victory, Woods made an appearance in Butler Cabin to receive his fifth green jacket from 2018 champion Patrick Reed. Sliding on the jacket, a wry smile crept across his face.

Convenient, packed with amenities, but at a price that makes the luxury of location affordable. A 15-minute walk or a five-minute bus ride brings guests to Universal Orlando\u2019s two theme parks, plus the shopping and dining at CityWalk, with its cinema multiplex, Hollywood Drive-In mini-golf and the home of theatrical sensation Blue Man Group. The resort is also right next to new water park Volcano Bay. Walt Disney World is 11 miles (17km) along motorway I-4, and Orlando International Airport is a convenient 17 miles (27km). A complimentary shuttle takes guests to SeaWorld and Aquatica. Divided into three distinct sections, retro-themed Cabana Bay\u2019s funky detailing brings to mind the roadside motels of the 1950s and 60s. Delightfully kitschy touches add to the nostalgia, notably the antique cars parked out front. The resort is made up of four low-rise tower blocks with a mixture of interior and exterior access, and twin 12-storey towers, which include 20 two-bedroom/two bathroom suites and grandstand views over Volcano Bay. The lovable Minions from the film Despicable Me visit the resort on Fridays, which adds to the family fun. Easy access to the theme parks is the big draw, but the resort has much more to enjoy. The Cabana Courtyard section offers an enormous zero-entry pool with water slide and an interactive children\u2019s play area, while Lazy River Courtyard features a pool and blissful lazy river for tubing. A 10-lane bowling alley and Ace Arcade are ideal for the occasional rainy day or an evening in, and health-conscious visitors have access to state-of-the-art Jack LaLanne Fitness Studio. At parents\u2019 discretion, children can be given pre-arranged charging privileges on their room key. Bold orange, blue and green d\u00e9cor follows through on the throwback theme without feeling obtrusive or overwhelming. Standard rooms sleep four, family suites sleep six, and two-bedroom/two bathroom suites sleep up to eight. Suites feature two televisions (three in two-bedroom suites) and a well-equipped kitchenette. Split bathrooms in the standard rooms and a compartmentalised bathroom (toilet and sink in separate rooms to shower) in the Beachside/Bayside tower suites are supremely family-oriented, especially for those eager to take advantage of the early entry perk into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter sections of the theme parks. Dining is limited, but the caf\u00e9 style Bayliner Diner food court features full breakfasts or breakfast sandwiches, plus soups, salads, pizza, burgers and an international selection at lunch and dinner, including Brazilian beef, vegetarian Lo Mein and Roast Chicken, and it makes a welcome break from the higher-priced offerings at nearby CityWalk.

The resort is also right next to new water park Volcano Bay. Walt Disney World is 11 miles (17km) along motorway I-4, and Orlando International Airport is a convenient 17 miles (27km). A complimentary shuttle takes guests to SeaWorld and Aquatica. Divided into three distinct sections, retro-themed Cabana Bay\u2019s funky detailing brings to mind the roadside motels of the 1950s and 60s. Delightfully kitschy touches add to the nostalgia, notably the antique cars parked out front. The resort is made up of four low-rise tower blocks with a mixture of interior and exterior access, and twin 12-storey towers, which include 20 two-bedroom/two bathroom suites and grandstand views over Volcano Bay. The lovable Minions from the film Despicable Me visit the resort on Fridays, which adds to the family fun. Easy access to the theme parks is the big draw, but the resort has much more to enjoy.

Suites feature two televisions (three in two-bedroom suites) and a well-equipped kitchenette. Split bathrooms in the standard rooms and a compartmentalised bathroom (toilet and sink in separate rooms to shower) in the Beachside/Bayside tower suites are supremely family-oriented, especially for those eager to take advantage of the early entry perk into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter sections of the theme parks. Dining is limited, but the caf\u00e9 style Bayliner Diner food court features full breakfasts or breakfast sandwiches, plus soups, salads, pizza, burgers and an international selection at lunch and dinner, including Brazilian beef, vegetarian Lo Mein and Roast Chicken, and it makes a welcome break from the higher-priced offerings at nearby CityWalk.

Athletes of pro football accomplish feats that seem impossible to us mere mortals as we watch the games unfold from the comforts of our living rooms or tucked away in the stands. With so many unique entities inhabiting the football universe, it's hard to truly decipher who the truly transcendent players are. Oddly enough, sometimes we understand it best with what disappoints us, rather than what impresses us. On Monday there was that sense of foolish disappointment looking at the box score for Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt. Wait, he only tallied 101 rushing yards in Kansas City's 29-20 victory over the Redskins? No 50-yard runs or end-zone trips? We'd come to expect more, after all, from the player who took his first 47 career carries for 401 yards and scored six total touchdowns. It's in the moments when you realize that a workhorse-like 25-touch, 121 total-yardage game internally registers as a letdown that reality sets in. Hunt is in the middle of a truly special season. The NFL just witnessed a transcendent season from a rookie running back last season. Drafting Ezekiel Elliott with the fourth-overall pick, and the subsequent selection of Dak Prescott, changed the trajectory of the Dallas Cowboys. Elliott was a tone-setter for the 2016 Cowboys, an engine for their drive to the NFC's No. 1 seed while quickly becoming the story of the season. Through four games, it's not outrageous to suggest that Hunt, a third-round draft pick, is set to have an even better campaign. All running backs are products of their environment. No rusher can truly function without proper blocking and even great backs -- see Todd Gurley's 2016 -- can be foiled when planted in a poisonous offensive soil. The mark of a good back is being able to succeed in well-established conditions and getting the yards blocked for them. The great backs are the ones who create yards beyond just what they're given. Hunt has been the best back this season at creating on his own. Through the first four games, he's gained an average of 6.1 more yards after a defender closes within one yard of him (NFL average is 3.6), leading the NFL among running backs with more than 25 carries. For comparison's sake, Elliott in 2016 averaged 4.4 yards after defenders closed within a yard of him. He ranked third in that category among backs with more than 200 carries. Elliott is a special player in the open field, a threat to break tackles and take any run for six. So far, Hunt looks like Elliott's equal in that regard. In his first few games it was easy to say that Hunt's stats were boosted by big runs. Indeed, plays like the 69-yard run against the Chargers to close out a Week 3 contest did boost his overall statistical finish. However, what we saw out of Hunt against Washington was a more sustaining runner. While the massive highlight reel runs didn't come in waves, he consistently gained positive yardage, going down for a loss on only two carries. Hunt stacked steady run after steady run, before eventually breaking two 15-plus yard plays. Kareem Hunt's #NextGenStats rushing chart from tonight. These types of consistent, offense-sustaining brand of games are what will really solidify Hunt as one of the best backs in the NFL. We all love big plays and they often flip the field to differentiate winners and losers. However, in close games when the offense needs to build up drives as the clock runs, a performance such as Hunt's latest is exactly what an NFL team looks for. Hunt was that player Monday, and he improved as an individual runner as the game went on. While he averaged 3.0 yards after a defender closed within a yard during the first two quarters, he improved to a 3.4 average in the second half. True feature backs get better as the game goes on. One area where Hunt does appear to have an edge on Elliott is in the passing game. Hunt has made several big catches in the early portions of his rookie campaign, whereas Zeke was less of a factor with less than 40 catches back in 2016. Hunt averaged 3.5 air yards per target, a notably high rate for running backs. Slot receivers like Randall Cobb and Jarvis Landry sit at 5.9 and 5.6 on the season, for comparison. Of course, if Hunt is to sustain such a special pace and truly enjoy a rookie-of-the-year campaign on par with Elliott's 2016, he'll need two more accompanying notes. The first is what all running backs need, as mentioned earlier: a little help from his friends. Elliott's blending with the Cowboys fabled offensive line made for the ingredients to an ideal dish. Elliott averaged 0.6 yards before a defender closed within a yard of him, doubling the league average of 0.3. The Next Gen Stats help to quantify the dominance of Dallas' 2016 and also help show that their decline this year is dragging Elliott back to mere mortal levels of production. Through four games, the argument can be made that Hunt enjoys an even better cast of characters opening lanes for him. The rookie back averages a whopping 1.3 yards before a defender closes within a yard of him this season. He's making the plays on his own once he gets to the second-level, so there's nothing to take away from him, but the Chiefs system and his offensive line are plowing lanes for him to show his best work. Additionally, now that the spotlight is firmly on him, Hunt will need to show he can still excel even when defenders are keying in on him. Elliott thrived in epic fashion when put to this test last season. The Cowboys and Zeke saw a stacked box (eight-plus defenders) on 28.9 percent of his carries in 2016 but it carried little weight. Elliott averaged 4.7 yards per carry on those plays, the fourth-highest among backs with 200-plus rushes. Hunt has consistently drawn that extra attention this year, seeing a stacked box on 32.4 percent of his carries. Through the first month of the 2017 campaign, it's been no damper to his ability. Hunt averages 8.0 yards per carry when facing stacked boxes this year, second-highest among backs with 20-plus carries. However, it's worth noting that Washington gave him the most trouble thus far in his NFL career. The Redskins stacked the box on 38.1 percent of Hunt's carries and he averaged just 1.9 yards per carry on those plays. Again, if this is truly going to be an Elliott 2016-type season for Hunt, Hunt will need to produce closer to his previous level in this regard. The NFL is full of surprises, but it's hard to come up with a bigger shock than the dominance of Hunt through the quarter mark of the 2017 regular season. No matter your expectations, he's exceeded them. As taken aback as we all were when Elliott took the league by storm as a rookie, it's even more outrageous to see a player drafted 82 spots later the following year do the same. It's all the more impressive that through four games, it's not outlandish to assert that Hunt is doing what Elliott did, and just might outdo him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "Published: Oct. 3, 2017 at 01:41 a.m. Updated: Oct. 3, 2017 at 04:11 a.m. The NFL is full of undeniably special players.

We've gotten glimpses of Corey Stoll's Yellowjacket villain from Ant-Man in a poster that debuted in December and promo art that arrived in February, but we have never seen an official image of the costume as it will be seen in the movie, until now. Entertainment Weekly has debuted a new photo as part of their summer movie preview, which gives us our best look at Yellowjacket yet, as he prepares to throw a punch at a diminutive Ant-Man. You honestly have to squint and focus to see the tiny Marvel superhero, but trust us, he's there. As you can see in the photo below, Cross' Yellowjacket costume is armed with plasma cannons, which puts Ant-Man at quite a disadvantage, although, when Ant-Man shrinks, his strength increases, according to director Peyton Reed. \"Hank Pym's Ant-Man suit doesn't have a single weapon, whereas Yellowjacket is armed with plasma cannons. Ant-Man is very fast when he's small. Also, when he shrinks, he increases his density, so he's got increased strength.\" Paul Rudd also talked about how playing Scott Lang was a completely new experience for him, since he had to wear a motion capture suit. \"It was a new experience as far as the motion-capture-suit-ness of it. But none of it feels that different. Every part, I'm pretending to be somebody I'm not. It's all just a big lie!\" Peyton Reed also shot down some recent reports that Ant-Man has already went through reshoots. The director states that there will be some additional photography, but he chalked it up to \"minor stuff.\" \"I love turning on the computer in the morning and reading the things that I did the day before-that I didn't do! We are going to do a little bit of additional photography, but we have not done any yet. It's minor stuff.\" Take a look at Yellowjacket below, and let us know what you think of this villain's look.

The way the plasma cannons on his yellowjacket costume provide a disadvantage for Ant-Man is a great visual. The increased density in Scott Lang's new Ant-Man suit also highlights how Yellowjacket's powers might give the main character a different advantage.\n\nIt's also interesting to see how director Peyton Reed has described his experience playing Scott Lang. The fact that he had to wear a motion capture suit can be quite an experience, but he's managed to blend the lines between the actor and the character. This adaptation allows the actor to fully embody Scott Lang's personality while still keeping the core of the personality intact.\n\nThe reports that Ant-Man has gone through reshoots can make audiences wonder if they'll see the complete version of the movie, but it seems that there are plans for some additional photography. Since it's minor stuff, fans can look forward to seeing the updated version of Scott Lang's Ant-Man suit and some additional visuals in the movie.\n\nOverall, this photo gives us a great look at Yellowjacket's unique appearance and highlights the new dynamics between the main character, Ant-Man, and his arch-nemesis. As a huge Ant-Man fan, I'm looking forward to seeing these character developments in person. Will Ant-Man be one of this summer's biggest hits?

Next to the supermarket, a squat building covered with wooden boards has a pile of animal skins mouldering outside. It may seem surprising, but this could be the site of a revolution in pet preservation. Inside Mac's Taxidermy, Mike Mculloch labours under rack after of buck and deer antlers. As the hunting season reaches a climax, there is a steady flow of customers clutching heads to be gutted, boned and mounted as trophies. In Pennsylvania, 1.8 million hunting licences are granted every year. But over in the corner of the store there's something else going on. Two freezers are joined in the middle by tubing and a vacuum pump. And inside the two freezers, what were once pets are now being slowly dried out. Mike Mculloch can hardly believe the line of business he has entered into. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen\", he chuckles. \"I never started this taxidermy business to do dogs and cats. I bought the freeze dryers because we do small animals in them, that are very difficult, that are hard to skin and do the conventional way. \"And then this all started out about five years ago with a friend of a friend who asked me if I could help him out with his dog,\" he said. There's not much difference in the finished product between a stuffed animal and a freeze-dried one, Mike says. But stuffing is labour intensive for small animals; for a moose or a buck you gut and bone the head and neck and then stretch the hide over a polyurethane frame. But those frames aren't made for smaller animals - so the bone and muscle structure needs to be recreated - and that means the price goes to around $2,500. Which is where the freezer comes in. Freeze-drying - dropping the temperature of the animal to the point where water turns to a gas and then drawing the gas off with a vacuum pump - costs around one fifth of the price of stuffing. And customers are queuing up, with pets coming over from all over the States - so far he has taken in pets from Texas, California and Florida. \"I don't understand them,\" he says, adding, \"but then I don't understand people paying $2,000 to bury them and put a headstone up as well. It's a big business in this country - they cremate their dogs and cats and they spend three or four thousand dollars for an urn to put them in.\" Business is very good at Mac's Taxidermy; new freezers are on order and new investors want to set up a whole new pet freeze-drying company. Along with the success have come odd requests. One man in Ohio has asked, in return for a sum which Mike Mculloch will only describe as \"very substantial\", that his entire body be frozen. Mike is still pondering that one. Profit margins are up and so far there's little competition on the horizon; other taxidermists just aren't interested. Mike says he'll probably make more money this year in all the other years he has been in business. Deputise that one thing has changed for the worse - the mood in Mike's shop. It's gone from triumph to tragedy. \"We're used to people coming in here,\" he says \" and they're all excited - they've got a big buck, or a bear or a mountain lion, and they're all excited. It's completely different now - the people come in with their dogs and cats and they're crying. I understand it but it's a completely different things for us.

It may seem surprising, but this could be the site of a revolution in pet preservation. Inside Mac's Taxidermy, Mike Mculloch labours under rack after of buck and deer antlers. As the hunting season reaches a climax, there is a steady flow of customers clutching heads to be gutted, boned and mounted as trophies. In Pennsylvania, 1.8 million hunting licences are granted every year. But over in the corner of the store there's something else going on. Two freezers are joined in the middle by tubing and a vacuum pump. And inside the two freezers, what were once pets are now being slowly dried out. Mike Mculloch can hardly believe the line of business he has entered into. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen\", he chuckles. \"I never started this taxidermy business to do dogs and cats. I bought the freeze dryers because we do small animals in them, that are very difficult, that are hard to skin and do the conventional way. \"And then this all started out about five years ago with a friend of a friend who asked me if I could help him out with his dog,\" he said. There's not much difference in the finished product between a stuffed animal and a freeze-dried one, Mike says. But stuffing is labour intensive for small animals; for a moose or a buck you gut and bone the head and neck and then stretch the hide over a polyurethane frame. But those frames aren't made for smaller animals - so the bone and muscle structure needs to be recreated - and that means the price goes to around $2,500. Which is where the freezer comes in. Freeze-drying - dropping the temperature of the animal to the point where water turns to a gas and then drawing the gas off with a vacuum pump - costs around one fifth of the price of stuffing. And customers are queuing up, with pets coming over from all over the States - so far he has taken in pets from Texas, California and Florida. \"I don't understand them,\" he says, adding, \"but then I don't understand people paying $2,000 to bury them and put a headstone up as well. It's a big business in this country - they cremate their dogs and cats and they spend three or four thousand dollars for an urn to put them in.\" Business is very good at Mac's Taxidermy; new freezers are on order and new investors want to set up a whole new pet freeze-drying company. Along with the success have come odd requests. One man in Ohio has asked, in return for a sum which Mike Mculloch will only describe as \"very substantial\", that his entire body be frozen. Mike is still pondering that one. Profit margins are up and so far there's little competition on the horizon; other taxidermists just aren't interested. Mike says he'll probably make more money this year in all the other years he has been in business. Deputise that one thing has changed for the worse - the mood in Mike's shop. It's gone from triumph to tragedy. \"We're used to people coming in here,\" he says \" and they're all excited - they've got a big buck, or a bear or a mountain lion, and they're all excited. It's completely different now - the people come in with their dogs and cats and they're crying. I understand it but it's a completely different things for us. It's just different.\"", "generated_text": "The article describes the unusual and unsettling world of taxidermy, specifically at Mike Mculloch's store in Fort Loudon, Pennsylvania. The shop has transformed into a small, quirky business that focuses on freeze-drying small animals, typically pets, as a form of preservation.\n\nThe author describes the atmosphere as one of triumph and innovation, as Mike has successfully established a lucrative business by providing a unique service that caters to the high-paying end of the animal market. However, beneath the business's fa\u00e7ade of success lies a dark side. The author notes that a disproportionate number of customers are bringing in dead pets from across the country, often accompanied by emotional and often disturbing explanations for why they want to part with their beloved animals.\n\nOne notable customer who stands out in the article is a man from Ohio who asks Mike to freeze his entire body, reportedly in exchange for a substantial sum of money. Mike is left to ponder this request, adding a sense of unease and discomfort to the story.\n\nThe transformation of the shop from a happy, thriving business into a somber and heartbreaking one is starkly illustrated through Mike's observations of the changed clientele. While the initial excitement and enthusiasm of the customers is understandable, as people seek out unique and specialized services, the subsequent shift to emotional attachment and desperation reveals a more sinister aspect to the business.\n\nMoreover, the contrast between the initial excitement of the clients and the sombre tone that follows is striking.

RFA recently learned that the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has accused him of espionage on behalf of unnamed foreign powers. RFA contacted Liem in Ho Chi Minh City and spoke with him on the morning of August 28. The interview was aired in its entirety on August 28 during the 9 to 10 p.m. broadcast to Vietnam. Among his remarks to RFA's Vietnamese service, Le Quang Liem, 80, shared several important pieces of information. The government of Vietnam accuses him, through an intensive press campaign, of being the henchman of foreign powers to plot the \"overthrow of the legal and constitutional government of Vietnam.\" This campaign began in April. Conversely, the CPV had also informally sought Liem's cooperation to be made chairman of an advisory committee on religious questions. \"I have refused and said it will not do. Why, they asked me. I said that... a religion should be independent and not be an appurtenance of the government. Let them organize a public conference gathering all the major leaders of the Hoa Hao in the nation - the conference can even be presided over by a government person - and let them present their opinions. Only then can we know what they want. And to start with, the government should not interfere or try to guide them one way or the other. This will not do.\" He also spoke of his rebuff of an attempt to draw him into a scheme that would have embarrassed the government on April 30 - the anniversary of the fall of Saigon. In response to the suggestion Liem said, \"my stand is a purely religious stand, I do not engage in politics and I do not cause disturbances. My struggle, while very tough, is also non-violent. I believe that all violence and sabotage only causes misery to people and harms them.\" Even if a grenade can kill a communist leader, he would be replaced right away by another, according to Mr. Liem. \"That is why I believe that killing people is not the solution whereas the real need of the Vietnamese people at the present time is freedom, the restoration of freedom. Now, freedom and human rights happen to be the main trend of the whole world. That is why we should struggle...to get the support of the whole world and force a change of direction on the communist regime, so that they have to grant the people their basic freedoms. That is the main point.\" Le Quang Liem also said he does not believe in the establishment of a government-in-exile especially since the main powers, including the United States, have changed direction from military confrontation to a policy of peaceful engagement. \"As for the distribution of leaflets, grenade throwing, setting off land mines or other explosives, these are all murderous weapons killing the innocent. That is a crime and I am incapable of such a crime.\" In closing, Liem said: \"They want to come for me? I am ready. I tell you, I am not sure where my struggle will lead me, and it's sort of doubtful that I will be able to help my church very much. I might end up in jail or even get killed, it's all equal to me.\" RFA just learned that yesterday, August 28, Nguyen Van Dien, second in command to Le Quang Liem, has been arrested by the authorities - possibly in connection with the same charge leveled at Liem.

He also cautioned against government interference in the internal affairs of the church.\n\n- **Struggle for Freedom and Human Rights:** Liem's stance on the Vietnamese War and the government came across as nonviolent but still resistant to the idea of supporting a communist regime.

The timing wasn't right. And what could have been is now a gym up for auction. WAVELAND \u2013 Inside Waveland gym with its musty smells and wooden bleachers and peeling brick walls, what could have been is unmistakably raw. This gym is 1954 \u2013 frozen in time. Plopped in the middle of a tiny town \u2014 population 419 \u2014 in the southwest corner of Montgomery County, the gym is a reminder of a time when basketball ruled. Waveland was a powerhouse in the 1950s. No one in the county could beat the Hornets. The stage at the end of the gym, meant for school plays, had folding chairs on Friday nights, seats for fans when the bleachers were packed to the walls. People would pour out into the school halls on tiptoes, trying to catch a glimpse of the action. Wire bingo-calling contraptions lie on the side of the court \u2013 wooden balls inside with their faded B-5s and G-54s. They are dust-covered reminders of the the chili suppers that took place before home games, when townswomen brought in their cream pies and chocolate steam cakes. The locker rooms are suffocating, barely wide enough for two players going opposite directions to pass. One toilet. Two urinals. A dozen metal lockers. The windows in the dank basement are shut now. But in the 1950s, players would leave them unlatched so they could sneak in to shoot in the dark gym. The producers of \u201cHoosiers\u201d saw the magic. They came to visit the gym, built in 1937, in the early 1980s. They saw the perfect spot to film their iconic movie based on the Milan miracle of 1954. But the timing didn\u2019t work out. And no one in Waveland knew. They had no idea what their little pocket of Indiana was missing out on. The school board got the request from Angelo Pizzo, an unknown writer and filmmaker from Bloomington, who was working on his first movie. The premise of the film: A small town Indiana school wins a state basketball championship, featuring the fictional team of Hickory Huskers, which was loosely based on the real 1954 Milan team. But the Waveland board had already signed contracts and the town had passed a bond to demolish the old school attached to the gym and build an elementary school. \"We were looking for one location where we could shoot it all,\" Pizzo said in the book \"Historic Hoosier Gyms,\" written by IndyStar's Kyle Neddenriep. \"The school, the downtown square, the gym \u2014 all of it. We found the perfect place at Waveland.\" But despite pleas from Pizzo and his partner, David Anspaugh, to hold off on the construction, Waveland voted no to \"Hoosiers\" being filmed at their gym. \"Unfortunately we got word of 'Hoosiers' a little too late,\" said Mike Mitchell, who was on the school board at the time. \"It\u2019s too bad, because Waveland had everything we needed \u2014 the town, the gym, the school,\" Anspaugh said years later. Instead, the fictional town of Hickory was shot in three different locations: New Richmond, Nineveh and, for the gym, Knightstown. That Knightstown gym, now called The Hoosier Gym, has reinvented itself into a museum and community center. The Waveland gym, vacant and full of so many memories, is up for auction next month. It is being sold with the now-vacated elementary school. \"That gym was a big deal to the community,\" said Ralph Jones, who owns the property with his wife, Brenda. The couple had tried for several years to get a charter or Christian school going. \"That's what I'd like to see happen,\" Jones said. \"Outside of that, as long as it\u2019s good for the community, then it's good with me.\" Other have talked of turning the gym and school into a community center or, perhaps, offices. Mitchell, who was a standout player at Waveland in the 1960s and ended his career as the second-leading scorer in school history with 1,473 career points, said he is torn about the sale of the gym. \"I have no idea what it should be. I hate to see it just decay,\" said Mitchell, who was also the first Waveland player to achieve a 50-point game. \"I\u2019ve seen a few gyms that have been abandoned over the years and I guess they kind of die a slow death. I would hate to see that happen to it.\" The Waveland Hornets had incredible success from 1949 to 1953, winning the sectionals four times. They were 25-0 in 1951 before losing 50-49 to Covington in the regional final at Clinton. \"It was very much like Hoosiers,\" said Mitchell, who grew up next to the Waveland gym. Keith Greve was a star of the team during that era and went on to start four years at Butler University, playing for Tony Hinkle. He was later inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. His brother, Bill Greve, graduated as the career scoring leader at Waveland and in Montgomery County history with 1,777 points. That placed him fifth in Indiana high school basketball history when he graduated in 1955. He went on to play four years for Purdue and was inducted this year into Indiana's hall of fame. There was most certainly magic that happened inside that gym \u2014 whether it ever made it to the big screen or not. \"You wouldn't believe the stuff I get to see,\" said Paul Miner, who works for Lawson & Co., the auction company that is selling the property, as he looks up at the vintage scoreboard hanging in the gym. \"Yep. This is what Indiana basketball was about.\" The Waveland gym was last used as a high school gym in 1971, when the school consolidated with Ladoga and New Market to form Southmont that year. From then on, it was part of the elementary school. But when the elementary school was demolished in the 1980s to make way for a new one, the gym remained. No one wanted to see it go. Built in 1937, the Waveland gym was a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The school at the time was kindergarten through 12th grade \u2014 about 250 students total. Many of the graduating classes had 13 to 15 students, said Dave Fullenwider, who attended Waveland until it was consolidated in 1971. Through the years, so much has happened inside that gym. Fall carnivals, Christmas programs, community meetings. Fullenwider said in the 1950s, on Friday nights, two ticket booths would set up outside of the gym. People would line up along the sidewalk to buy tickets to the game before school let out. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, the gym remained packed for basketball. \"'Hoosiers' (producers) came in there and said the town was perfect, the school was perfect, the gym was perfect,\" said Fullenwider. \"A first grade teacher at the time said, 'They were dying to film here.'\" Alas, that didn't happen. And what could have been has passed. \"I'd like to see something good come of it,\" said Fullenwider. \"I just hate to see it torn down, especially with the rich history of the gym.\" See the inside story of Indiana's rich tradition of high school basketball in IndyStar's new hardcover book, \"History of Our Hysteria: Indiana High School Basketball.\" This collector's item will feature stunning historic images and compelling stories, and is sure to be a showpiece on your coffee table.

The 1954 Milan team, a fictional team in the film \"Hoosiers,\" which was also inspired by the Milan team, went on to win the state championship, featuring the fictional Hickory Huskers team that would later become the subjects of the film.\n\nThe 1954 Waveland gym is being put up for sale next month, with the now-vacated elementary school that the gym belongs to up for auction. The gym has been vacant for several years, and the community seems to be holding onto the memories and nostalgia of its rich history. Despite being a relic of the past, the gym still maintains much of its original charm and character, making it a unique and valuable asset for the community and local developers.\n\nAuctions of historic homes and buildings can be a complex process, and the Waveland gym is no exception.

He wrote the speech that Ronald Reagan, poised dramatically under a bust of Lenin, delivered to students at Moscow State University. The event was a highpoint of the Moscow summit. Now Josh Gilder is working for George Bush - crafting the first of many speeches which he hopes will help put the vice-president over the top in the fall elections. ``I'm struggling with the transition, because I'm writing for a candidate versus the President,'' says the youthful Mr. Gilder, even though he is not a newcomer to the Bush operation. He worked as a Bush speechriter for two years before being tapped for the presidential job in late 1985. The struggle is understandable. The President's delivery is so impeccable that even a bad speech can be made to sound good. Vice-President Bush, on the other hand, does not have the reputation of a good speaker, especially when he is viewed on television. Bush, he adds, although he is younger than Reagan, is a more old-fashioned politician who got his experience on the stump in Texas, delivering extemporaneous remarks on the back of a pick-up truck five times a day. Reagan, by contrast, is a politician of the television age. If Bush does not come through well on TV, says Gilder, his strengths lie in his knowledge of the issues and the fact that he is an honest man. ``He couldn't dissemble if he tried,'' says the speechwriter. It is clear that Gilder already is thinking in terms of Bush as a doer, perhaps in response to the Democrats' effort to build up Dukakis as a pragmatic manager. ``Reagan is the great visionary and Bush is the man that can implement that vision,'' he says. He cites the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Arms) Treaty. The ``vision'' was the two-track policy of negotiation and deployment that led to the treaty. But it was George Bush who convinced the allies to move ahead with deployment of the nuclear missiles in the face of domestic opposition. A political speechwriter does not make up his own ideas, of course. He seeks to capture and embody his client's views and values. In the case of Reagan, says Gilder, he went back to the President's 1964 ``A Time for Choice'' speech in support of Barry Goldwater to understand his most fundamental views. It helps, of course, to share those views. Although he attended Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts institution where he studied literature and music, Gilder is an unabashed conservative. After graduation he wrote for such conservative periodicals as American Spectator, the Wall Street Journal, and New Criterion. After joining the White House in 1983, Gilder's first speech for Bush was for a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating entrepreneurs. Later he wrote more substantial pieces, including the speech Bush delivered at a foreign policy conference in Vienna in 1983 on Yalta, in which he declared that the West would never accept the division of Europe. During his two years with Bush, he says, the vice-president penned a great deal himself. Sometimes he wrote out his ideas on a legal pad aboard a plane and handed it to a writer for crafting just before a public appearance. There is an art to writing for presidents and politicians. Gilder takes issue on which - when writing for someone for who is not a brilliant speaker - short, choppy sentences are called for. Speechwriting for the President is not a solo operation. A draft speech is vetted by many people, from White House and National Security Council aides to State and Defense officials. All can and often do suggest changes. Finally, the draft is shown to the President himself, who frequently makes substantive as well as editorial changes. While the White House has a stable of writers, many of whom earn a reputation in their own right, they do not tout their authorship of presidential speeches. The whole idea is to fashion a speech which, infused with the President's ideas and delivered with the rhythm uniquely his own, becomes ``his'' speech. In working on the speech, Gilder sought advice from James Billington, head of the Library of Congress and author of ``Icon and the Ax.'' He also talked with Yakov Smirnov, the Soviet 'emigr'e and standup comic who is becoming known to US audiences for his witty comments about Soviet society. The President, Gilder says, wanted to talk about the importance of freedom and what it means. Yakov, he says, helped make the theme concrete in terms of Soviets' own experience. Reagan ended up talking about freedom in churches, freedom in the schoolroom, freedom in the courtroom. He mentioned his own experience leading a union strike as president of the Screen Actors Guild. ``We are breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny,'' the President declared. Drawing on ideas uttered by Reagan over the decades, Gilder sought to make the speech not a ``challenge'' to the Soviet students, he says, but an ``embrace of the possibilities'' if the USSR opened up its system. Reagan praised Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform effort and voiced hope for its success. Reagan's speech was laced with the names of literary and other figures, among them Gogol, Pasternak, Lomonosov, George Washington. Even an Uzbek poet - Alisher Navoi. Though Reagan could not have known about all of them, the name-dropping had a purpose. The Gilder draft went into circulation twice and, unlike many other speeches, ``sailed through,'' with a few presidential changes Gilder declined to describe.

Bush, wrote the speech that Ronald Reagan delivered to students at Moscow State University during the Moscow summit. This speech was a highpoint of the Moscow summit and showcased Bush's skills as a politician and writer.\n\nGilder has been working with Bush for several years and has been tasked with crafting speeches to help Bush win over the public and sway voters in the presidential election. As the speechwriter notes in the article, Bush is a more old-fashioned politician compared to his predecessor, President Reagan, who is a product of the television age.\n\nBush, according to Gilder, lacks the reputation of being a skilled speaker, and his delivery is likely to be scrutinized by the public. In contrast, Vice-President Bush has a reputation as a knowledgeable and honest politician, which Gilder believes will serve him well in the election.\n\nGilder's speechwriting process involves working with a team of advisors, including White House and National Security Council officials, to ensure that the final draft is polished and effective. The process involves a series of revisions and edits, including showing the speech to Bush himself and receiving feedback from various stakeholders.\n\nOne notable aspect of Gilder's speechwriting process is his reliance on the ideas of others, particularly in terms of his focus on the importance of freedom and the possibility of reform in the Soviet Union.

DOJ says Officer Erik O'Brien fired fatal shot. GREEN BAY - A Green Bay man who was shot and killed Friday by Green Bay Police had been arrested earlier that night on a warrant for failing to report to jail for a 2017 drunken driving conviction. Jonathon C. Tubby, 26, was identified by the state Department of Justice on Friday as the man shot and killed Oct. 19 in the sally port at the Brown County Jail. The sally port is an enclosed, garage-like area where officers drive in, park and walk suspects to and from the jail. Two Green Bay Police officers, Erik O\u2019Brien and Colton Wernecke, are on paid administrative pending the outcome of an investigation of the shooting by DOJ's Division of Criminal Investigation. State law requires the investigation of police shootings be conducted by an outside agency. O'Brien was the only officer to fire his weapon during the incident, DOJ said. O'Brien is a six-year veteran of the department. Wernecke is a trainee with three months on the job. No other information about the shooting has been made public. The family asked for prayers, encouragement and support, in a statement released Friday by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. They also asked the community to respect their privacy and to refrain from speculation about the events surrounding Tubby's death. \"Through the night there have been stories and recollections of Jonathon and what a compassionate caring young man he was. Jonathon loved to dance, sing, and make people laugh. He was compassionate and took care of everybody he loved the best he could. He was very athletic and enjoyed football and lacrosse,\" the family's statement said. Tubby and a woman who has not been named by police were arrested for outstanding warrants during a traffic stop about 7:20 p.m. Oct. 19, near the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in the 300 block of Main Street, police said. Court records show a warrant for Tubby's arrest was issued in May after he failed to report to jail to serve a 60-day sentence for a May 2017 conviction of second-time drunken driving. Officers became concerned about Tubby's behavior while driving him to the Brown County Jail, according to online police radio archives. He was shot and died shortly after 9 p.m. In a statement, the DOJ said a large number of police officers were present when Tubby was shot because of the length of the incident at the jail. The investigation is expected to take about 60 days to complete. Police radio transmissions posted online shed some light on what happened the night of Tubby's death, including an 8:30 p.m. call in which an officer told the county dispatch center that Tubby had, \"something in his shirt, pointed up at his chin.\" About 8:55 p.m., officers reported being unable to see Tubby's face in the patrol car.

DOJ says Officer Erik O'Brien fired fatal shot. GREEN BAY - A Green Bay man who was shot and killed Friday by Green Bay Police had been arrested earlier that night on a warrant for failing to report to jail for a 2017 drunken driving conviction. Jonathon C. Tubby, 26, was identified by the state Department of Justice on Friday as the man shot and killed Oct. 19 in the sally port at the Brown County Jail. The sally port is an enclosed, garage-like area where officers drive in, park and walk suspects to and from the jail. Two Green Bay Police officers, Erik O\u2019Brien and Colton Wernecke, are on paid administrative pending the outcome of an investigation of the shooting by DOJ's Division of Criminal Investigation. State law requires the investigation of police shootings be conducted by an outside agency. O'Brien was the only officer to fire his weapon during the incident, DOJ said. O'Brien is a six-year veteran of the department. Wernecke is a trainee with three months on the job. No other information about the shooting has been made public. The family asked for prayers, encouragement and support, in a statement released Friday by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. They also asked the community to respect their privacy and to refrain from speculation about the events surrounding Tubby's death. \"Through the night there have been stories and recollections of Jonathon and what a compassionate caring young man he was. Jonathon loved to dance, sing, and make people laugh. He was compassionate and took care of everybody he loved the best he could. He was very athletic and enjoyed football and lacrosse,\" the family's statement said. Tubby and a woman who has not been named by police were arrested for outstanding warrants during a traffic stop about 7:20 p.m. Oct. 19, near the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in the 300 block of Main Street, police said. Court records show a warrant for Tubby's arrest was issued in May after he failed to report to jail to serve a 60-day sentence for a May 2017 conviction of second-time drunken driving. Officers became concerned about Tubby's behavior while driving him to the Brown County Jail, according to online police radio archives. He was shot and died shortly after 9 p.m. In a statement, the DOJ said a large number of police officers were present when Tubby was shot because of the length of the incident at the jail. The investigation is expected to take about 60 days to complete. Police radio transmissions posted online shed some light on what happened the night of Tubby's death, including an 8:30 p.m. call in which an officer told the county dispatch center that Tubby had, \"something in his shirt, pointed up at his chin.\" About 8:55 p.m., officers reported being unable to see Tubby's face in the patrol car.

Two Green Bay Police officers were involved in the shooting: Erik O'Brien and Colton Wernecke. O'Brien is a six-year veteran of the department and is currently on paid administrative leave while under investigation.\n\nThe DOJ has stated that the investigation into the shooting is expected to take around 60 days to complete, and it will include interviewing more than two dozen officers, witnesses, and other individuals involved in the event.\n\nIt is worth noting that Jonathon Tubby's family has reached out to the community for support and encouragement during this time. Their statement expressed appreciation for the prayers and well wishes for the investigation and those potentially involved in responding to the incident.\n\nThe public's speculation about the events surrounding Tubby's death is discouraged by the family's request for respect during this difficult time, urging the community to not share or speculate about the incident unless officially confirmed by law enforcement officials.

It's slightly smaller than a baseball. Crab cakes are kind of like Princess Bride Meghan Markle's wedding dress: Either you loved the simplicity or you wanted more adornment. I'm in the less-is-more camp, with both the dress and the crab cake. This summer, I'm on the hunt for the best places in Delaware to get a crab cake. While this isn't a new quest, it's been almost 10 years since our last Great Crab Cake search. I started at a perennial favorite, Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar in Lewes. The restaurant has been well-known for its crab cakes for more than 15 years and it remains a strong contender as a place to go for a memorable crab cake experience. Keep reading for more on Gilligan's. In my experience, Delaware diners seem to prefer patties made with sweet, unbroken hunks of colossal, jumbo lump, lump or back fin meat. The less said about claw meat, the better. Classic crab cake recipes can include crumbled saltines, eggs, mayonnaise, lemon butter and even bread soaked in milk. These are traditional bindings that hold the cakes together. Embellishments, like sprinkles of Old Bay seasoning, a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a small spoonful of dry or prepared mustard aren't uncommon. Crab cakes can be broiled, baked, sauteed or fried. Squabbles over the cooking methods are to be expected. Don't draw me into this fight, I'm not going to say one is better than another. Tell me where you go for hefty cakes packed with sweet meat, not overly seasoned, mushy-tasting, hockey puck-shaped disks that try to pass for one of our region's favorite foods. We'll check out your suggestions and feature some of the best ones throughout the summer. Email me at ptalorico@delawareonline.com. Almost every successful restaurant in Delaware has some kind of dish with crab meat. It's a staple of Mid-Atlantic cuisine, especially in the First State since the blue crab is common in all of Delaware's tidal waters. Crabbing also is a popular recreational resource and the blue crab tops the list of the state\u2019s economically important marine fish and shellfish. In Delaware, the blue crab season generally runs from the beginning of March through the end of November. Availability is dependent on the weather. Crab cakes can be on the pricey side because of the labor involved in getting the perishable meat. An average blue crab weighs about 1/3 pound, but the edible portion is quite low. An experienced crab picker can produce about 2 1/4 ounces of meat from each pound of live blue crabs, according to information from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. This is just about a 14 percent yield. The actual yield depends on the size of the individual crab and experience of the crab picker. Crab processors on the Eastern Shore have said they are worried about shortages and escalating prices this season because many plants don't have enough workers to pick crab meat, according to a story last month in The Baltimore Sun. The meat the employees pick is sold in area markets and to restaurants. Workers, who mostly come from Mexico, can't get visas due to a new lottery system started by the Trump administration, The Sun reported. Previously, visas were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Prices could rise throughout the summer as demand grows greater. Cheryl Tilton, owner of Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar, says crab meat prices recently have been \"through the roof.\" Tilton only uses jumbo lump crab meat for her crab cakes and usually purchases the meat from the Lewes Fishhouse or Samuels & Son Seafood Co., a wholesale restaurant supplier based in Philadelphia. The cost has been $28 a pound. \"I like the big lumps of crab meat,\" she says. \"We're hoping that we at least get through the season. There is a shortage.\" Joe Lasprogata, vice president of Samuels & Sons, says area restaurants buy both fresh and pasteurized crab meat. \"Both products are extremely expensive right now,\" he says. \"It's a crazy demand. We can't get enough live crabs. There's a huge demand in this area.\" Fresh crab meat is pricey because it's extremely perishable. \"It has to be used immediately,\" Lasprogata says. Pasteurized crab meat, which is easier for restaurants to use because it lasts longer and has no shells, usually comes from China, the Philippines and Indonesia, he says. Crab prices usually remain high throughout the summer, and then fall in September and October. While the crab cakes at Gilligan's have always been a high point of the eatery's menu, it had been years since I had one. If you haven't been there lately, the restaurant at 134 W. Market St. has undergone a complete transformation. When it reopened last year, the year-round business, next to the Inn at Canal Square, had a completely new look. The original restaurant had been built around a dry-docked, 38-foot cabin cruiser rescued from the Florida Keys, a corn crib salvaged from a historic building in Ellendale and a former chicken coop. But Tilton said she was tired of working in a building that was falling down around her, so that structure was razed. Now, a new building is in its place. Gilligan's has 62-seats indoors and 68-seats outdoor and a harbor view that overlooks the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal. There's also a private dining room that be rented for events like wedding rehearsal dinners and baby showers. The marina atmosphere fuels the urge for seafood. We pre-gamed with an appetizer of steamed Little Neck Clams ($13) immersed in a briny, brothy wine bath flecked with sweet corn and soppressata, a slightly spicy Italian cured meat. It's a very good beginning to a meal, though the \"crusty\" bread was almost too crusty. Leaving it to soften in their irresistible broth didn't help much. Not wanting to risk a possible trip to the dentist, we asked for replacement bread. But our server said all the bread that was available was just as \"crusty\" because it was made ahead of time. But we were really here for the crab cakes, and they did not disappoint. Calling Gilligan's crab concoction a cake is really a misnomer. This is a \"flash-fried\" crab ball that is, perhaps, just slightly smaller than a baseball. \"It's pretty big,\" Tilton says of the portion that's close to 10 ounces. \"Even though the prices have gone up, we still want to offer the same quality.\" Tilton says she has been using the same recipe \"as I've done all the time, since we started here 16 years ago.\" The jumbo lump crab meat is held together with only a whisper of mayonnaise. Then, it's rolled into panko breadcrumbs. Tilton says each cake is put into a fryer \"really quick,\" just so it gets crispy on the outside. \"That's the best way,\" she says. Believe her. The filling is all crab, pure and simple. It's a very ample portion and I could have easily split one with a friend. A crab cake sandwich, which comes with homemade potato chips, is $20. A crab cake entree, available after 5 p.m., is $30. It's served with fingerling potatoes and \"whatever seasonal vegetables we have,\" Tilton says. You also can get a crab cake (crab ball?) on a bed of greens or, for an extra charge, on top one of the restaurant's salads. I like the Power House Salad ($12), greens tossed with sliced avocado and carrots, along with chickpeas, alfalfa sprouts and cooked barley. Tilton says the restaurant's kitchen staff makes the crab cakes every morning for that day's service. She can also make them without the panko breadcrumbs, but only with advance notice. \"We have a few customers that are gluten-free and they call in advance. If you call in advance, and let's us know you're coming, and you've been here before, we can do it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "Calling the jumbo lump crab concoction at Gilligan's Waterfront Restaurant & Bar in Lewes a cake is a misnomer.

They offer a variety of side dishes and salads, but their crab cakes are the main event.\n- The Boathouse Waterfront Restaurant in Rehoboth Beach: This seafood restaurant has a long history of serving up massive, indulgent crab cakes made with jumbo lump crab meat and a blend of cheeses that adds a rich, buttery flavor to the dish.

They are met with curiosity, indifference and open hostility. Jewish Israeli, Palestinian, and international activists carried three black panels bearing some 100 names through the streets of what is now the Givat Shaul neighborhood of West Jerusalem on Thursday. They marched to commemorate the massacre and displacement of the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin by Zionist militias 66 years ago on April 9, 1948. Organized by the Israeli organization Zochrot, whose name means \u201cremembering,\u201d the event memorialized those killed and recounted the village\u2019s history to Israeli passers-by, who were at times curious, indifferent and hostile. A woman passing the procession as it assembled on Kanfey Nesharim Street complained to her companion, \u201cOh, it must be that Deir Yassin crap.\u201d A young worker in a sandwich shop asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d and snapped a photo with his iPhone. Just three days prior, vandals had spray-painted \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d on grave markers in Deir Yassin\u2019s cemetery. As the participants carried the names along what was once the main street of a thriving Palestinian village, it was most often children who stopped to listen to Zochrot\u2019s Umar Al-Ghubari recount the significance of a particular location along the way, or to read the names of the dead. The Deir Yassin massacre was a pivotal moment of the Nakba and in the lead-up to the 1948 War. Some 100-200 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed by the extremist Zionist militias the Irgun (Etzel) and Stern Gang (Lehi). Some were shot in battle, others executed. Others were killed when grenades were thrown into their houses. In some cases, whole families were gunned down. Exact numbers of the dead were disputed from the start, as even the perpetrators of the massacre inflated the death toll in order to sow terror throughout other Palestinian communities so that they would flee their homes. Other villages did indeed flee in fear, but the massacre also cemented the motivation of neighboring Arab countries to fight rather than accept partition. A member of the Hagana Zionist militia present for Thursday\u2019s procession recounted his role in the massacre: removing the bodies after the Irgun and Stern Gang had done most of the dirty work. He described it as the worst thing he ever experienced. My grandmother\u2019s cousin, Naziha Radwan, was six at the time of the massacre. She survived by covering herself in her grandmother\u2019s blood, hiding beneath stiffened bodies and pretending to be dead. It was hard to imagine these horrific events taking place on what now is a busy city street lined with shops and restaurants, eventually terminating in a park with playgrounds, basketball courts, and the Kfar Shaul mental hospital, whose buildings include a few of the original homes that were once the center of the village. Across the valley lies the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. In the aftermath of the massacre, prominent Jewish scholars, including Martin Buber, urged Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to leave Deir Yassin uninhabited, or at least that its settlement be postponed, writing that it had become \u201cinfamous throughout the Jewish world, the Arab world and the whole world.\u201d Their repeated messages were ignored. Prior to the massacre, we were on good terms with the Jews in Givat Shaul. We shared food, celebrated together, paid condolences to one another, babysat for each other. There was peace here before the Zionists came and destroyed everything. Zochrot\u2019s mission is \u201cto challenge the Israeli Jewish public\u2019s preconceptions and promote awareness, political and cultural change within it to create the conditions for the Return of Palestinian Refugees and a shared life in this country.\u201d While getting the Israeli Jewish public to acknowledge the injustices of the Nakba in general and the massacre of Deir Yassin in particular may be an unpopular uphill battle, a shared life based on a just and lasting peace will not be possible without such truth-telling. The British National Archives released in April last year, contained a report written by Sir Alan Cunningham, the last High Commissionar of the British Mandate authority in Palestine, dated April 30, 1948. In the report Cunningham mentioned the massacre at Deir Yassin by calling the Jewish militia which carried the massacre, \u201cterrorists, Nazis and savages\u201d. Our one eyed Rehmat strikes again. Obviously Arabs did die in Deir Yassin. That is beyond dispute. But was it an atrocity? And if it was, then was it exaggerated out of all proportion? According to some Arab notables and eye witnesses, it certainly WAS exaggerated.

Benny Morris writes that the Irgun and Lehi troops loaded some survivors, including women and children, onto trucks, and drove them through the streets of West Jerusalem, where they were jeered, spat at, and stoned. The head of the Haganah Intelligence Service in Jerusalem, Yitzhak Levy, wrote in reports dated April 12 and 13: \u201cThe conquest of the village was carried out with great brutality, whole families [including] women, old people and children were killed and there are piles and piles of dead.\u201d He wrote that a mother and child who had been moved from Deir Yassin to Sheikh Badr were killed there by Lehi fighters. Seven old men and women, who had been taken to Jerusalem, were taken back to Deir Yassin and killed in the quarry there, he wrote, and an Arab man, believed to be a sniper, was killed and his corpse burned in front of foreign journalists. Jacques de Reynier, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Palestine, and his assistant Dr. Alfred Engel, visited Deir Yassin on April 11. In his personal memoirs, published in 1950, Reynier wrote: \u201ca total of more than 200 dead, men, women, and children. About 150 cadavers have not been preserved inside the village in view of the danger represented by the bodies\u2019 decomposition. They have been gathered, transported some distance, and placed in a large trough (I have not been able to establish if this is a pit, a grain silo, or a large natural excavation). \u2026 [One body was] a woman who must have been eight months pregnant, hit in the stomach, with powder burns on her dress indicating she\u2019d been shot point-blank.\u201d He wrote that he had encountered a \u201ccleaning-up team\u201d when he arrived the village. The gang [the Irgun detachment] was wearing country uniforms with helmets. All of them were young, some even adolescents, men and women, armed to the teeth: revolvers, machine-guns, hand grenades, and also cutlasses in their hands, most of them still blood-stained. A beautiful young girl, with criminal eyes, showed me hers still dripping with blood; she displayed it like a trophy.

Jacques de Reynier, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Palestine, and his assistant Dr. Alfred Engel, visited Deir Yassin on April 11. In his personal memoirs, published in 1950, Reynier wrote: \u201ca total of more than 200 dead, men, women, and children. About 150 cadavers have not been preserved inside the village in view of the danger represented by the bodies\u2019 decomposition. They have been gathered, transported some distance, and placed in a large trough (I have not been able to establish if this is a pit, a grain silo, or a large natural excavation). \u2026 [One body was] a woman who must have been eight months pregnant, hit in the stomach, with powder burns on her dress indicating she\u2019d been shot point-blank.\u201d He wrote that he had encountered a \u201ccleaning-up team\u201d when he arrived the village. The gang [the Irgun detachment] was wearing country uniforms with helmets. All of them were young, some even adolescents, men and women, armed to the teeth: revolvers, machine-guns, hand grenades, and also cutlasses in their hands, most of them still blood-stained. A beautiful young girl, with criminal eyes, showed me hers still dripping with blood; she displayed it like a trophy. This was the \u201ccleaning up\u201d team, that was obviously performing its task very conscientiously.", "generated_text": "The article you've provided sheds light on the atrocities committed by Zionist militias in the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin in 1948, nearly 66 years ago. The names of 100-200 Palestinians, including women and children, who were killed by these militias, have been left to gather dust, often forgotten in the midst of Israeli celebrations and memorials.\n\nThe mention of Deir Yassin's significance in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be met with a nuanced understanding of this pivotal moment in the struggle for Palestinian rights. The massacre of Deir Yassin marked a pivotal moment in the Nakba (Catastrophe) and the lead-up to the 1948 War, during which thousands of Palestinians lost their lives.\n\nThe article also highlights the discrepancy between the numbers of deaths attributed to those involved in the conflict and those claimed by the perpetrator groups themselves. This perpetuates a false narrative that Palestinians were the primary perpetrators while downplaying the significant role of Zionist militias.\n\nThe mention of the brutality carried out by the Zionist militias and the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation during their visit to Deir Yassin should be documented and recognized as part of human rights history.\n\nUltimately, the recognition of Deir Yassin's significance lies in acknowledging the past, promoting awareness of the historical injustices faced by Palestinians, and advocating for the principles of truth-telling, justice, and human rights.

If you think about it, none of us really have 365 days a year to work. Weekends and work holidays erase more than 100. What you really have is 200 days a year to make it happen.

I productized my service so clients can subscribe by credit card. Now I get paid even while I'm away. Paying percentage points to my processing vendors is worth it. If you hate billing and collections like I do, create subscribers, not customers. Passive income is even better (via investments, affiliate arrangements, etc.). 4. Hire the right partners, managers and experts. You and your team should be able to work from anywhere. Captain Jean-Luc Picard had his number one. Who's yours? Hire your No. 1 as quickly as possible to help out when you're away. He or she can be a virtual assistant, but a vested right-hand COO \"commander\" has worked better for me. All of my businesses have been partnerships. Like marriages, making them work is worth it. 5. Identify vulnerabilities and continuously improve. Nothing shows cracks in your processes like going on vacation. Of course, this presumes your team follows standard operating procedures. But it's your responsibility as the owner to work on your business systems, as Michael Gerber advises. Systems are more than just checklists. Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline, wants us to leverage our systems' interdependencies. The best systems create whole value beyond the sum of its parts. A business is a system of systems; it's much more valuable when the owner isn't its key vulnerability. 6. Return refreshed and rejuvenated. Some of our vacations are more hectic than day-to-day business life. And many of us return to more work piled up than before. But disconnecting from daily work is supposed to help us reconnect with our purpose, passion and priorities. I like to allow myself a one-day staycation after a trip.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they must change. In times of economic crisis, companies are quick to slash IT costs. With fears of a recession looming over the corporate world, CIOs are facing the axe once again. But no matter how many times CIOs proclaim their strategic value--or the strategic value of their departments--businesses too often view IT as a cost, plain and simple. IT executives have been rallying against that perception for years, but they're getting little attention. Howard Rubin says it's about time that changed. An IT benchmarking pioneer and self-proclaimed \"metrics arms dealer,\" Rubin is a former fellow with corporate strategy consultancy Norton, Nolan & Co., where he developed metrics for application portfolios and helped create the balanced business scorecard. He also serves as a senior adviser to Gartner and a research affiliate to the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management. A former executive vice president of META Group and professor emeritus of computer science at Hunter College of the City University of New York, Rubin has been an IT adviser to the U.S., Canadian, Indian and other governments. Rubin says businesses see better results when they make sound IT investments during economic downturns. When they don't, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. And the cost of catching up, he says, can be insurmountable. But CIOs are as guilty as their bosses in misinterpreting the true value of IT investments. To turn the tables, Rubin says, IT executives must recast the conventional language around IT expenditures and strategy. Rubin recently spoke with CIO Insight online editor Brian P. Watson about what companies do wrong in valuing their IT investments, and what CIOs must do to change that perception. What follows is an edited transcript of their discussion. CIO INSIGHT: What's the biggest problem today with the way companies view their IT investments? Rubin: It's been a long-term problem: Most companies view their IT investment as a cost and therefore they try to minimize the cost. Corporate leaders always ask me how they can use benchmarks to compare themselves with their peers, and how they can compare against best in class. Best in class, in conventional wisdom, is typically who's doing IT for the least amount of dollars, relative to revenue, relative to operating expense. Best in class sometimes is synonymous with who's the low cost in IT. That's a big problem, because the low cost may not be the best user of IT. When people talk about understanding how to calibrate themselves, they need to redefine best in class in terms of the aspirations of the business.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they must change. In times of economic crisis, companies are quick to slash IT costs. With fears of a recession looming over the corporate world, CIOs are facing the axe once again. But no matter how many times CIOs proclaim their strategic value--or the strategic value of their departments--businesses too often view IT as a cost, plain and simple. IT executives have been rallying against that perception for years, but they're getting little attention. Howard Rubin says it's about time that changed. An IT benchmarking pioneer and self-proclaimed \"metrics arms dealer,\" Rubin is a former fellow with corporate strategy consultancy Norton, Nolan & Co., where he developed metrics for application portfolios and helped create the balanced business scorecard. He also serves as a senior adviser to Gartner and a research affiliate to the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management. A former executive vice president of META Group and professor emeritus of computer science at Hunter College of the City University of New York, Rubin has been an IT adviser to the U.S., Canadian, Indian and other governments. Rubin says businesses see better results when they make sound IT investments during economic downturns. When they don't, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. And the cost of catching up, he says, can be insurmountable. But CIOs are as guilty as their bosses in misinterpreting the true value of IT investments. To turn the tables, Rubin says, IT executives must recast the conventional language around IT expenditures and strategy. Rubin recently spoke with CIO Insight online editor Brian P. Watson about what companies do wrong in valuing their IT investments, and what CIOs must do to change that perception. What follows is an edited transcript of their discussion. CIO INSIGHT: What's the biggest problem today with the way companies view their IT investments? Rubin: It's been a long-term problem: Most companies view their IT investment as a cost and therefore they try to minimize the cost. Corporate leaders always ask me how they can use benchmarks to compare themselves with their peers, and how they can compare against best in class. Best in class, in conventional wisdom, is typically who's doing IT for the least amount of dollars, relative to revenue, relative to operating expense. Best in class sometimes is synonymous with who's the low cost in IT. That's a big problem, because the low cost may not be the best user of IT. When people talk about understanding how to calibrate themselves, they need to redefine best in class in terms of the aspirations of the business. Best in class could be, what's the spending pattern of the companies that are most profitable in our industry the last three years, or what are the spending patterns of the companies that have increased their business performance earnings per share the last three years? Companies treat IT like a cost and look for outside validation to drive costs down. They really should be looking at the outcome. What should I do with my IT strategy, my IT investment; am I maximizing return? That's better from a business perspective. Companies understand that IT produces value. But they view IT as a cost because it's so much harder to figure out where the value shows up in terms they can get their hands on.

CIO Watson discussed with Rubin several key points on how companies often misinterpret the value of IT investments:\n\n1. **Perceiving IT as a cost rather than a strategic asset**: Rubin stressed that most companies view their IT investment as a cost and try to minimize costs. They often look for external validation to justify costs, rather than examining the actual outcome of IT investments in a business context.\n\n2. **Misinterpreting the \"best in class\" concept**: In a conventional sense, \"Best in class\" refers to those who achieve the least amount of cost relative to revenue and operation Expense (OPEX). Rubin argues that companies often misunderstand the aspirations of companies that are most profitable and use the \"low-cost\" benchmarking approach instead of their desired spending patterns.\n\n3. **Focusing solely on a tangible metric (operating expenses) rather than outcome-driven evaluation**: When analyzing IT metrics, companies often default to operational expenses, but this view only acknowledges the cost incurred. To effectively assess return on investment for IT projects, CIOs must examine the impact on business goals beyond just the bottom line, i.e., the outcome of those investments.\n\n4. **The'self-feeding system' of IT costs**: Rubin pointed out that the way IT costs are reported, with \"compensation\" being reported before \"communications and technology,\" makes", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.196152422706631, "p": 1.0172773068362062e-07, "detected_greenlist_number": 195, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8872383236885071, "Recall": 0.8725099563598633, "Accuracy": 0.8803333044052124}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8872383236885071, "Recall": 0.8725099563598633, "Accuracy": 0.8803333044052124}, "total_statistics": [2628.0, 2654.0, 334.0, 384.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2628.0, 2654.0, 334.0, 384.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 42}

The appointment of a Super Rugby captain during this competitive phase of the season could be a vital step for Erasmus, who needs all the guidance and support he can get to ensure his team has a successful World Cup campaign.

Walker did not rule on the claim of jury misconduct and left open the possibility that he would hear testimony from jurors on the issue later. Walker also did not rule on Hubbard's motion for a new trial during this morning's hearing, which lasted about two hours. The judge denied prosecutors' request to order Hubbard to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the state. A Lee County jury convicted Hubbard on 12 felony ethics charges in June. Walker sentenced him to four years in prison and ordered him to pay $210,000 in fines. Hubbard, who is out on bond, attended this morning's hearing. In July, Hubbard's lawyers filed a motion asking for an investigation after a juror gave the defense a sworn statement saying that other jurors made comments during the trial indicating a bias against Hubbard. Hubbard's motion asks for an investigation by the Lee County Sheriff's Department or \"another similarly situated neutral law enforcement agency.\" Walker, however, said he found no precedent in case law for such an investigation and that he was not inclined to be a \"pioneer.\" Walker said he was prepared to hear testimony on the matter, including from the juror who gave the affidavit. Hubbard attorney Bill Baxley said the defense was not prepared to call witnesses today but wanted, instead, to let the sheriff investigate and present findings to the court. This morning, Walker called to the witness stand two bailiffs who worked the case. In response to questions from the judge, both said they did not hear witnesses discussing the case. The two said they alternated sitting beside the jury box during the trial. Walker also called Court Administrator Patricia Campbell to the witness stand. The juror who gave the affidavit alleging jury bias brought those concerns to Campbell during the trial, according to the affidavit. Campbell testified today that a juror told her that another juror was making comments in the jury box such as \"uh huh,\" \"yes\" and \"now the truth is coming out.\" Campbell said she told Walker, who directed her to tell a bailiff to speak with the juror making the comments. That bailiff, Bobby Bond, testified that Campbell told him to talk to a juror who was making comments under her breath. Bond said he called the juror aside and told her not to do that. Bond said no other complaints about the jury were brought to his attention. Hubbard's lawyers pressed their claim of jury misconduct after hearing today's testimony. \"There's no way Mike Hubbard got a fair trial,\" attorney Lance Bell told Walker. Prosecutors have said Hubbard is seeking an \"unfettered fishing expedition into the jury\" by his request for an investigation. They say the affidavit alleging misconduct is inadmissible because rules of evidence exclude juror testimony about \"internal influences\" on the jury. Before Walker sentenced Hubbard, prosecutors asked him to order Hubbard to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the state under the reasoning that the state was the victim of his crimes. Walker rejected that argument before sentencing and did so again today. The amount, $1.1 million, was the total amount of consulting contract payments and business investments Hubbard received from the transactions for which he was convicted. Prosecutors had argued that Hubbard should not be allowed to keep \"ill-gotten gains obtained as a result of breaching the public's trust.\" \"It would be a just order for this court to enter because this defendant has no legitimate right to that money,\" Deputy Attorney General Mike Duffy told Walker. Baxley called their request a \"ludicrous claim,\" saying that Hubbard's case did not involve taking any money from the state or any payments made by the state. \"They're just seeking a windfall and trying to be vindictive,\" Baxley said. Baxley told Walker the strongest reason that a new trial is justified was the testimony of former Ethics Commission Executive Director Jim Sumner. Sumner testified as an expert witness for the state. He testified about finer points of the ethics law, including the definition of \"principal,\" the legal term for a person or business that hires a lobbyist, and about what kind of transactions would be covered under a friendship exception in the ethics law. Baxley said the defense was not properly notified of Sumner's expert testimony and had no chance to try to rebut it. \"We were blindsided, bushwhacked and ambushed,\" Baxley said. Among Hubbard's convictions are that he solicited and received investments of $150,000 for his debt-strapped Craftmaster Printers business from each of four business executives. The jury found the investments violated the ethics law prohibition against a public official receiving a thing of value from a principal because the four men were officials in companies that employ lobbyists. Three of the four, Great Southern Wood President Jimmy Rane, Hoar Construction President Robert Burton and former Business Council of Alabama Chairman Will Brooke, all testified that they were longtime friends of Hubbard. Hubbard's lawyers argue that the friendship exception should have applied to their investments in Hubbard's business and the transactions were not crimes. Assistant Attorney General Megan Fitzpatrick said the jury made the determination of whether the friendship exception applied after hearing all the testimony and evidence. Walker asked prosecutors about Rane's investment in Craftmaster Printers, noting that Rane testified that Rane and Hubbard had been friends since the 1980s. Rane made the investment from personal funds, not his company's funds. \"Where is the connection between Great Southern Wood and Craftmaster?\" Walker asked prosecutors. Kirkpatrick told the judge that Rane's status as a principal did not change because he used personal funds to make the investment. She noted that a transaction does not have to be a \"quid pro quo,\" an official action in exchange for money or a favor, to be a crime under the ethics law. Sumner had testified that the friendship exception was intended to apply to exchanges like gifts or shared expenses on a joint vacation. Deputy Attorney General Duffy told Walker said Alabama has the \"toughest ethics law in the country\" because it defines individuals who are officials with companies that hire lobbyists as principals, not just the companies themselves. Otherwise, Duffy said there would be a loophole in the law because those officials could reimburse themselves with company funds for individual transactions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "Lee County Circuit Judge Jacob Walker today denied the request of former House Speaker Mike Hubbard's lawyers for a sheriff's investigation into possible misconduct by the jury that convicted Hubbard.

They also comment on the cultural significance of whining, particularly in societies with a strong narrative arc, like the one presented in the novel by Mark Twain that the author alludes to.\n\nThe passage critiques the tendency of modern individuals to focus on their personal shortcomings, rather than acknowledging broader societal issues that affect the greater good. The author recognizes that whining is often an escape from the perceived injustices and inequalities of the world, and that the burden of sharing personal struggles can be crushing and demoralizing.\n\nThe author's final lines, which suggest that those who \"don't know what they are doing or can't get their act together\" are particularly prone to whining, serve as a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls of indulging in excessive self-comparison and self-pity.\n\nIn many ways, the passage reflects on the evolution of social media, which has amplified and normalized the art of complaining, and the ways in which it can erode empathy", "detection_result": {"z_score": 6.928203230275509, "p": 2.131073095767988e-12, "detected_greenlist_number": 210, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8691652417182922, "Recall": 0.8569028973579407, "Accuracy": 0.8650000095367432}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8691652417182922, "Recall": 0.8569028973579407, "Accuracy": 0.8650000095367432}, "total_statistics": [2551.0, 2639.0, 384.0, 426.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2551.0, 2639.0, 384.0, 426.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 49}

The Forest Service had attempted to stabilize certain areas of the dunes through planting invasive species and trees, but it appears that the effort was in vain, and a mountainous foredune has formed.\n\nThe Forest Service has decided to shut down illicit OHV trails to OHV users, hoping that native species will overgrow the trails and reclaim the land.

While the article mentions that Talat has been trying to bring the communities together through peace negotiations, it highlights the ongoing challenges and the perception that his government was complicit in the 1974 coup.\n\nRegarding President Nicos Anastasiades' statement regarding the termination of the police chief, it is indeed hypocritical on the part of the President of the Greek Cypriot administration in southern Cyprus. Anastasiades blamed the chief for incompetence and failing to maintain security, without addressing the deeper reasons behind the incident, such as the security lapses during anti-privatisation protests and the rise of far-right groups like ELAM which promote a fascistic agenda.\n\nMoreover, the President's tone is overly emotive and accusatory, particularly when referring to Talat and his presence at a conference as a \"provocation.\" The incident has been described as the latest in a series of security lapses, and the President's statement should have acknowledged the complexities of the situation and the need for nuanced approaches to address the underlying issues.\n\nIt appears that the President is using rhetoric that may be alienating some within the Greek Cypriot administration and potentially exacerbating tensions between the two communities.

But why do we celebrate Easter and why is it so late this year? Easter is only days away with many getting ready for some time off work and school thanks to the bank holiday in the UK. The holiday, which is celebrated across the world, will start with Good Friday on April 19 and end on Easter Monday on April 22. Then celebration means Britons can soon tuck into copious amounts of chocolate eggs - but do you know why Easter is being celebrated? Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament of the Bible, the event is said to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in roughly 30 AD. Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities, essentially because he claimed to be the \u201cSon of God\u201d, and was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate. Jesus\u2019 death by crucifixion, marked by the Christian holiday Good Friday and subsequent resurrection three days later is said to have been done to prove that he was the living son of God. Easter also concludes the \u201cPassion of Christ\u201d - a series of events and holidays that begins with Lent. Lent is a 40-day fasting period which comes before Easter in the Christian and is a time for reflection in Christian traditions as well as for preparations before the celebration of Easter begins. Lent ends of Holy Thursday, which celebrates Jesus\u2019 Last Supper with his 12 apostles. The Easter holiday in the UK begin on Good Friday on which Jesus\u2019 crucifixion is observed and end on Easter Sunday. Easter is a moveable celebration so it can be hard to keep up to date on when it starts. Easter falls on the first Sunday after the Full Moon date, based on mathematical calculations, that falls on or after March 21. In 325 AD the Council of Nicaea ruled Easter would be held on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. However, if a the Full Moon falls on a Sunday, then Passover begins on a Sunday, so Easter is then delayed by a week to make sure it still occurs after Passover. Easter can be celebrated at anytime between March 22 and April 25, and this year\u2019s holiday is coming towards the end. Easter Sunday in 2019 will fall on April 21, meaning Good Friday will be on April 19 and the Easter bank holiday on April 22.

Over time, the celebration of Easter has been influenced by various cultural and historical factors, but its core purpose remains rooted in the Christian faith. The significance of Easter is multifaceted and extends beyond the Christian realm.\n\nHere are some key aspects that contribute to the importance of Easter:\n\n1. **Resurrection Legend:** The story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is central to the Easter narrative. The crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus are seen as messages from God regarding forgiveness, salvation, and the promise of eternal life.\n\n2. **Christian Tradition:** Easter is a fundamental part of the Christian year, preceding the 40-day period of Lent and the somber celebrations of Good Friday and Holy Saturday. Each of these periods has symbolic significance, representing preparation, introspection, and ascension in faith.\n\n3. **Pilgrim Significance:** In the past, Easter marked the beginning of the Christian pilgrimage, an emotional journey toward the celebration of Easter. This pilgrim movement allowed individuals and communities to reconnect with the events of Christ's life and the resurrection.\n\n4. **Symbolic Significance of the Colors:** The Easter bunny provides colorful symbols tied to Easter, including pastel colors and eggs, which carry significance within Christian contexts.

This should kill the pests and will likely prevent any further infestation.\n\n2.  Clean your plant care tools, including gloves and pruning shears, in hot soapy water or with a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar to reduce the chance of pest spillover.\n\n3.  After removing the treated mealybugs, wash the plant pot with soap solution to prevent pest spread in future plants.\n\n4.  Consider introducing neem oil to create chemical deterrents to repel insects, if not for a long-standing pest problem, they might still need a good clean-up session, then reapply neem oil to create chemical deterrents.\n\n5. Monitor and maintain good plant hygiene practices to reduce pest populations. Consider repotting the plants with fresh potting mix, clean tools, and ensuring good air circulation inside plants to discourage pests from spreading further.\n\nAs for your cat's behavior with houseplants, try to keep your cat occupied with toys and treats that are poisonous to cats.

What is hyped is all the negatives. Let me read the opening paragraph \u2019cause it\u2019s really all you need to get the idea of this piece. Again, Andrew Sullivan. It\u2019s in New York Magazine. \u201cEarlier this week, I went to a lecture given by Steven Pinker on his latest book, Enlightenment Now. I\u2019m a huge and longtime fan of Pinker\u2019s, and his book The Blank Slate was, for me, a revelation. [Pinker]\u2019s become a deep and important critic of the visceral hostility to nature and science now so sadly prevalent on the left and right, a defender of reason and the Enlightenment against the \u2018social justice\u2019 movements on campus, and his new book is a near-relentless defense of modernity. \u201cI sat there for an hour slowly being buried in a fast-accumulating snowdrift of irrefutable statistics showing [amazing] human progress: the decline of violence and war, the rise and rise of democracy, the astonishing gains against poverty of the last couple of decades, the rise of tolerance and erosion of cruelty, lengthening lifespans, revolutions in health, huge increases in safety, and on and on. It was one emphatic graph after another that bludgeoned my current depression into a kind of forced rational cheeriness.\u201d In other words, this guy Pinker had been accumulating data to show that \u2014 in a universal way all over the world \u2014 all of our problems are getting better. But how many of you when I said, \u201cThe decline of violence and war,\u201d responded, \u201cWait a minute! There is not any decline\u2026\u201d? That\u2019s your instinct reaction, because what\u2019s on your mind is in Parkland, and we\u2019ve been at war in Afghanistan for seemingly, what, 18 years? \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the war in the Middle East 18 years. What do you mean less war? What do you mean less violence?\u201d Well, statistically, worldwide war is happening much less \u2014 so is violence \u2014 according to the stats. But in your living experience, it\u2019s kind of contradictory because it doesn\u2019t seem so, but that\u2019s the point. After looking at the evidence of how much improvement in the areas of squalor of life, you kind of have to do a check and say, \u201cWait a minute. This doesn\u2019t\u2026 This doesn\u2019t jibe with how I feel. It doesn\u2019t jibe with what I think I\u2019m seeing.\u201d Here\u2019s the last sentence of the paragraph: \u201cThere were no real trade-offs here; our gloom is largely self-imposed; and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d Bingo! Now, that may sound like deep stuff, but let me tell you what that means. What that means is we have forgotten the human flourishing, we\u2019ve forgotten the goodness, we have forgotten the happiness, the contentment that comes from a common idea of morality. My word in this case for virtue, and a concept of morality that is based our nature. These two paragraphs to me are dynamite. In the first place, \u201cour gloom is largely self-imposed and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d I could not agree more! That\u2019s why I have often suggested, if you want to change your life turn off news for a week and just see. Just do it. Turn off the news, do not watch any news. Do not watch any cable news anywhere for a week! You can do it. Don\u2019t be afraid. You can do it. You can listen to me because I do not make people feel unhappy or fill them with doom or gloom. Quite the opposite. This program lifts people up, makes people laugh. You know, we\u2019ve got this new thing we\u2019re doing at RushLimbaugh.com where we are actively responding to people. We\u2019re inviting people to get in touch with us, listeners, members of the audience, who we then establish a video connection with and we interview them and find out what is it about the program they like. It\u2019s revealing some of the best stuff. And people who participate in this, you can find where to do it at RushLimbaugh.com, in exchange for their participation people are allowed to ask me any kind of question they want and I\u2019ll answer it somehow, some way, either here or on another video that we put on the website or whatever. It\u2019s a work in progress. But the things that we are learning, the questions people want to ask me are better than any I have been asked by anybody on TV, by far, both personal and professional. And they\u2019re a joy to deal with. I answered one of these questions on a video last week. I hope we\u2019re able to post it this week. I\u2019m making no guarantees \u2019cause it\u2019s a new project that we\u2019re just getting up and running. But it is fabulous to actually learn and meet those of you in this audience who are participating in this. And it\u2019s a video conference that we set up with you, if you pass our tests. Well, \u2019cause we can\u2019t do everybody, got some fun little tests. But the point is, you know, there\u2019s a common thing these people say. And I would not have even thought to mention this today had it not been for this paragraph of Andrew Sullivan\u2019s. There\u2019s a common, almost everybody that we\u2019ve talked to \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of them now \u2014 are saying one variation or another that this program lets them know every day it\u2019s okay, that things are okay. And that has so much meaning to people. And the people that we\u2019re interviewing are all ages. They are all religions. They are all orientations, sexual orientations, gender. The demographic spread is amazing. It\u2019s fabulous to learn and see those of you who are participating in our little program here. Well, it\u2019s actually gonna get very big. But this is why I have said turn off the news. It is the most negative, particularly if you\u2019re a Republican or conservative or Trump supporter, it can ruin you. It can ruin your day. It can destroy a good mood. It can destroy contentment. And it shouldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s what it does. And if you turn it off for a week, you will see exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Turn it off for a week, but don\u2019t stop listening here. We don\u2019t make you feel gloomy. We don\u2019t make you feel like everything\u2019s doom and gloom and the end is near or anything like that at all. Quite the opposite. And then the admission here that we\u2019ve lost a common virtue, we\u2019ve lost a common morality, we\u2019ve lost a common base that unites us, that binds us together.

Because they\u2019re the ones at making things look as bad as they are when they really aren\u2019t.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "It\u2019s reported statistically, but it is never hyped. What is hyped is all the negatives. Let me read the opening paragraph \u2019cause it\u2019s really all you need to get the idea of this piece. Again, Andrew Sullivan. It\u2019s in New York Magazine. \u201cEarlier this week, I went to a lecture given by Steven Pinker on his latest book, Enlightenment Now. I\u2019m a huge and longtime fan of Pinker\u2019s, and his book The Blank Slate was, for me, a revelation. [Pinker]\u2019s become a deep and important critic of the visceral hostility to nature and science now so sadly prevalent on the left and right, a defender of reason and the Enlightenment against the \u2018social justice\u2019 movements on campus, and his new book is a near-relentless defense of modernity. \u201cI sat there for an hour slowly being buried in a fast-accumulating snowdrift of irrefutable statistics showing [amazing] human progress: the decline of violence and war, the rise and rise of democracy, the astonishing gains against poverty of the last couple of decades, the rise of tolerance and erosion of cruelty, lengthening lifespans, revolutions in health, huge increases in safety, and on and on. It was one emphatic graph after another that bludgeoned my current depression into a kind of forced rational cheeriness.\u201d In other words, this guy Pinker had been accumulating data to show that \u2014 in a universal way all over the world \u2014 all of our problems are getting better. But how many of you when I said, \u201cThe decline of violence and war,\u201d responded, \u201cWait a minute! There is not any decline\u2026\u201d? That\u2019s your instinct reaction, because what\u2019s on your mind is in Parkland, and we\u2019ve been at war in Afghanistan for seemingly, what, 18 years? \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the war in the Middle East 18 years. What do you mean less war? What do you mean less violence?\u201d Well, statistically, worldwide war is happening much less \u2014 so is violence \u2014 according to the stats. But in your living experience, it\u2019s kind of contradictory because it doesn\u2019t seem so, but that\u2019s the point. After looking at the evidence of how much improvement in the areas of squalor of life, you kind of have to do a check and say, \u201cWait a minute. This doesn\u2019t\u2026 This doesn\u2019t jibe with how I feel. It doesn\u2019t jibe with what I think I\u2019m seeing.\u201d Here\u2019s the last sentence of the paragraph: \u201cThere were no real trade-offs here; our gloom is largely self-imposed; and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d Bingo! Now, that may sound like deep stuff, but let me tell you what that means. What that means is we have forgotten the human flourishing, we\u2019ve forgotten the goodness, we have forgotten the happiness, the contentment that comes from a common idea of morality. My word in this case for virtue, and a concept of morality that is based our nature. These two paragraphs to me are dynamite. In the first place, \u201cour gloom is largely self-imposed and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d I could not agree more! That\u2019s why I have often suggested, if you want to change your life turn off news for a week and just see. Just do it. Turn off the news, do not watch any news. Do not watch any cable news anywhere for a week! You can do it. Don\u2019t be afraid. You can do it. You can listen to me because I do not make people feel unhappy or fill them with doom or gloom. Quite the opposite. This program lifts people up, makes people laugh. You know, we\u2019ve got this new thing we\u2019re doing at RushLimbaugh.com where we are actively responding to people. We\u2019re inviting people to get in touch with us, listeners, members of the audience, who we then establish a video connection with and we interview them and find out what is it about the program they like. It\u2019s revealing some of the best stuff. And people who participate in this, you can find where to do it at RushLimbaugh.com, in exchange for their participation people are allowed to ask me any kind of question they want and I\u2019ll answer it somehow, some way, either here or on another video that we put on the website or whatever. It\u2019s a work in progress. But the things that we are learning, the questions people want to ask me are better than any I have been asked by anybody on TV, by far, both personal and professional. And they\u2019re a joy to deal with. I answered one of these questions on a video last week. I hope we\u2019re able to post it this week. I\u2019m making no guarantees \u2019cause it\u2019s a new project that we\u2019re just getting up and running. But it is fabulous to actually learn and meet those of you in this audience who are participating in this. And it\u2019s a video conference that we set up with you, if you pass our tests. Well, \u2019cause we can\u2019t do everybody, got some fun little tests. But the point is, you know, there\u2019s a common thing these people say. And I would not have even thought to mention this today had it not been for this paragraph of Andrew Sullivan\u2019s. There\u2019s a common, almost everybody that we\u2019ve talked to \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of them now \u2014 are saying one variation or another that this program lets them know every day it\u2019s okay, that things are okay. And that has so much meaning to people. And the people that we\u2019re interviewing are all ages. They are all religions. They are all orientations, sexual orientations, gender. The demographic spread is amazing. It\u2019s fabulous to learn and see those of you who are participating in our little program here. Well, it\u2019s actually gonna get very big. But this is why I have said turn off the news. It is the most negative, particularly if you\u2019re a Republican or conservative or Trump supporter, it can ruin you. It can ruin your day. It can destroy a good mood. It can destroy contentment. And it shouldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s what it does. And if you turn it off for a week, you will see exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Turn it off for a week, but don\u2019t stop listening here. We don\u2019t make you feel gloomy. We don\u2019t make you feel like everything\u2019s doom and gloom and the end is near or anything like that at all. Quite the opposite. And then the admission here that we\u2019ve lost a common virtue, we\u2019ve lost a common morality, we\u2019ve lost a common base that unites us, that binds us together. The world is better than ever. Why are we so miserable? Social media plays a role in this too. But I don\u2019t know that social media is the cause of it. Social media just serves as a way to see it and to amplify it. And I don\u2019t think Trump hatred is hatred of Trump. I think it\u2019s hatred of all of us.

Sullivan highlights how the media and news diet often perpetuate gloomy and negative narratives, contributing to feelings of depression and hopelessness.\n\nSullivan argues that turning off news for a week can have a profound effect on one's mood and perception of the world. He notes that his own radio show has seen a significant jump in listeners, with some participants expressing relief and gratitude after removing themselves from the constant news cycle. Sullivan also shares a personal anecdote about how listening to a podcast that he created has helped to alleviate his own gloom and has allowed him to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and ages.\n\nSullivan attributes the world's overall improvement in these areas to various factors, including increased emphasis on science and reason, improvements in healthcare and human lives, and shifting societal attitudes towards tolerance and violence. However, he emphasizes that social media often perpetuates negative narratives and fuels hatred towards certain groups, distracting from the actual problems and solutions that need to be addressed.\n\nUltimately, Sullivan concludes that turning off the news for a day has allowed him to recapture a sense of hope and optimism, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating information and promoting positivity and resilience.

Law students are exposed to the principles, theories, and practices related to work-related matters.\n\n2. **Litigation**: Employment disputes often end up in the courtroom, making litigation a crucial area of study for law students. Understanding labor laws and regulations enables students to navigate these cases and develop strong advocacy skills.\n\n3. **Regulatory & Policy**: The regulations and policies governing employment practices are crucial in shaping the work environment and workplace conditions. Studying employment law helps students understand how regulations impact various aspects of work life, including labor rights, social security, and employment standards.\n\n4. **Transactional**: Employment law also intersects with commercial law when drafting employment contracts, negotiating labor agreements, or advising employers on compliance with employment regulations. Lawyers familiar with transactional aspects of employment help clients navigate complex business transactions.\n\n5. **As a related elective for those interested in Employment Law**: This elective program likely targets students who are interested in exploring employment law as a part of a broader legal education. For lawyers serving business clients, understanding human resources and employment law aspects of business transactions can enhance the value they bring to their clients.\n\n", "detection_result": {"z_score": 6.235382907247958, "p": 2.2533719334916213e-10, "detected_greenlist_number": 204, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8897034525871277, "Recall": 0.8771353363990784, "Accuracy": 0.8824999928474426}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8897034525871277, "Recall": 0.8771353363990784, "Accuracy": 0.8824999928474426}, "total_statistics": [2670.0, 2625.0, 331.0, 374.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2670.0, 2625.0, 331.0, 374.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 68}

Yemen is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis, and the country\u2019s children are bearing the brunt of the tragedy. Nearly 1.5 million children there are acutely malnourished, according to international aid organizations. Save the Children estimated that a third of all children under five in Yemen fall into this category. Of those, about 370,000 are said to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition \u2014 it means they are 10 times more likely to die than malnourished children because their immune system has been dramatically weakened. As that figure continues to rise, images like this are emerging from the country, where a civil war broke out last year. Despite some international attention, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The conflict has pushed the country to the brink of famine; in many remote villages, mothers themselves are too malnourished to feed their children. Majed Ayyash, a 21-month-old child who suffered from severe malnutrition, is one of the fortunate ones in the country's capital, Sanaa, because his family managed to get him to a hospital. But even when families manage to get their children medical help, the remaining doctors and nurses are forced to work with limited supplies and almost no equipment. A number of medical facilities in the country have been frequently targeted by airstrikes. Footage obtained by Save the Children \u2014 the UK-based humanitarian group has operated in the country since 1963 and supports 160 facilities there \u2014 and provided to BuzzFeed News shows children on ventilators, struggling even as they receive treatment in a Sanaa hospital. A full-blown civil war began in February last year after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee Sanaa. Since then, the Houthis have continuously clashed with Hadi, who is supported by local militia and tribespeople in the predominantly Sunni south of the country. Hadi says the Houthis are proxies for Iran, an allegation that Iran has denied. As a result, the Saudi-led coalition that has offered its support to Hadi has been engaged in airstrikes that have claimed thousands of lives, many of them civilians. Yemen, which imports 90% of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world before the outbreak of war, according to the Associated Press. Nearly 18 months into a Saudi-led blockade, the situation has become worse. This is 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod. He had acute malnutrition because his family was unable to afford food for him. Since the beginning of the war last year, the average cost of a food basket has gone up by 26%. Since April, the price has increased by 13%, according to a World Food Program Market Watch report in July. The situation has become so dire that according to Doctors Without Borders, it had to increase its staff's wages by up to 50% in some regions just so they could continue to buy food. In March, 10 out of 22 governorates in Yemen were considered on the brink of famine. Now, all but two are, according to a recent BBC report. Ali Mohammed al-Tawaari, a six-month-old boy, was being treated in Sanaa for acute malnutrition and other complications. \"If you look at his face, you can see that death is approaching,\" Ali's mother, Wadha, told Reuters, as they photographed her son in June last year. No one knows if Ali survived. In an interview with the BBC, Ashwaq Muharram, a Yemeni doctor, said that she was using her own money to buy medicine and food for her patients. \"The rich are now the middle class, the middle class are now the poor, and the poor are now starving,\" she said.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "raw_prompt": "A third of all the country's children under 5 are acutely malnourished.

Of those, about 370,000 are said to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition \u2014 it means they are 10 times more likely to die than malnourished children because their immune system has been dramatically weakened. As that figure continues to rise, images like this are emerging from the country, where a civil war broke out last year. Despite some international attention, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The conflict has pushed the country to the brink of famine; in many remote villages, mothers themselves are too malnourished to feed their children. Majed Ayyash, a 21-month-old child who suffered from severe malnutrition, is one of the fortunate ones in the country's capital, Sanaa, because his family managed to get him to a hospital. But even when families manage to get their children medical help, the remaining doctors and nurses are forced to work with limited supplies and almost no equipment. A number of medical facilities in the country have been frequently targeted by airstrikes. Footage obtained by Save the Children \u2014 the UK-based humanitarian group has operated in the country since 1963 and supports 160 facilities there \u2014 and provided to BuzzFeed News shows children on ventilators, struggling even as they receive treatment in a Sanaa hospital. A full-blown civil war began in February last year after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee Sanaa. Since then, the Houthis have continuously clashed with Hadi, who is supported by local militia and tribespeople in the predominantly Sunni south of the country. Hadi says the Houthis are proxies for Iran, an allegation that Iran has denied. As a result, the Saudi-led coalition that has offered its support to Hadi has been engaged in airstrikes that have claimed thousands of lives, many of them civilians. Yemen, which imports 90% of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world before the outbreak of war, according to the Associated Press. Nearly 18 months into a Saudi-led blockade, the situation has become worse. This is 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod. He had acute malnutrition because his family was unable to afford food for him. Since the beginning of the war last year, the average cost of a food basket has gone up by 26%. Since April, the price has increased by 13%, according to a World Food Program Market Watch report in July. The situation has become so dire that according to Doctors Without Borders, it had to increase its staff's wages by up to 50% in some regions just so they could continue to buy food. In March, 10 out of 22 governorates in Yemen were considered on the brink of famine. Now, all but two are, according to a recent BBC report. Ali Mohammed al-Tawaari, a six-month-old boy, was being treated in Sanaa for acute malnutrition and other complications. \"If you look at his face, you can see that death is approaching,\" Ali's mother, Wadha, told Reuters, as they photographed her son in June last year. No one knows if Ali survived. In an interview with the BBC, Ashwaq Muharram, a Yemeni doctor, said that she was using her own money to buy medicine and food for her patients. \"The rich are now the middle class, the middle class are now the poor, and the poor are now starving,\" she said.", "generated_text": "The crisis in Yemen is dire, with nearly 1.5 million children under 5 at high risk of acute malnutrition due to widespread hunger and shortages of food, healthcare, and other essential supplies. The situation has been further aggravated by a Saudi-led blockade that has led to a significant increase in the cost of basic commodities like rice, corn, and sugar. As a result, the average daily intake of caloric-rich food per child has dropped from around $3-4 in the past before the war to as low as $1-2 today, according to the World Food Program's Market Watch report.\n\nA significant portion of Yemen's children suffer from severe acute malnutrition, making them extremely vulnerable to death, as it occurs even when their immune system is weakened due to malnutrition. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a significant increase in severe acute malnutrition cases among children under five in Yemen since 2021.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Yemen has been plagued by a lack of access to food to many households, prompting mothers to resort to eating their children as a last resort. According to reports, up to nearly 70% of Yemen's children suffer from acute malnutrition, a significant portion of whom are not receiving any nutritional support at all, including their own children.\n\nThere are numerous healthcare facilities in Yemen that have faced significant challenges in terms of supply and equipment due to ongoing airstrikes and other conflicts, leaving families to fend for themselves despite the dire situation.

THE hard times made it all the sweeter for Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon as he celebrated his 13th grand slam title. The Serbian defeated Kevin Anderson 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7/3) to win his fourth Wimbledon crown, but first grand slam title since the French Open in 2016, which proved to be a dramatic turning point in his career. Novak Djokovic, right, is congratulated by Kevin Anderson after the men's singles final (Picture: John Walton/PA Wire). From holding all four slam titles Djokovic lost motivation, form and confidence before being forced to take six months off at the end of last season when elbow problems struck. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk now and look back at it and be kind of grateful, but I really am grateful to go through these kind of mixed emotions, turbulence, as well mentally, moments of doubt and disappointment and frustration, anger. Djokovic returned to the tour at the Australian Open in January, but his elbow was still hurting and in February he was forced to accept he needed to undergo surgery. Coming back in Indian Wells only a few weeks later proved a mistake with Djokovic a shadow of the player and competitor who dominated the tour for long spells between 2011 and 2016. But, after splitting from coach Andre Agassi and reuniting with mentor Marian Vajda, Djokovic gradually began to look more like his old self. There were signs on clay, but it was not until this tournament, and especially in his epic semi-final victory over Rafael Nadal, that there became no doubt the real Djokovic was back. He said, after taking a now-trademark taste of Wimbledon\u2019s grass: \u201cI couldn\u2019t pick a better place in the tennis world to peak and to make a comeback. Wimbledon has been always a very special tournament to me. I dreamed of winning it when I was a seven-year-old boy. I made a lot of improvised Wimbledon trophies from different materials. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to compare this year\u2019s victory and trophy with any of the other three because they\u2019re all special. Wimbledon do not allow children under five to watch matches in Centre Court, but three-year-old Stefan was brought into Djokovic\u2019s box for the trophy ceremony and shouted excitedly as his father walked over to do a BBC interview. Anderson was playing in his second slam final in less than a year after losing to Rafael Nadal at the US Open last summer. The 32-year-old South African, a late bloomer as a grand slam challenger, is learning the same lesson as many of his contemporaries: if one of the big fish does not get you, another one probably will. Of the last 46 slams, all but eight have been won by Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer. A career-best victory over Federer in the quarter-finals followed by an epic semi-final against John Isner kept Anderson on court for nearly 11 hours so it was no surprise that he was not as his best to start with. But he made a real fight of it in the third set where he held five set points. Anderson, who will rise to a career-high of No 5 in the world rankings, said: \u201cIt was a tough start for me. You always have high hopes. \u201cI was hoping to draw on some previous experiences, playing at the US Open in the final, obviously playing Federer a couple days ago. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really find my form the way I wanted to. Of course, my body didn\u2019t feel great, but I was definitely quite nervous starting out the match. I tried my best to keep at it. \u201cI definitely felt much better in the third set. I thought I had quite a few opportunities to win that third set. Barry Davies said it had \u201cbeen a lot of fun\u201d as he brought his commentary career to an end at Wimbledon. The 80-year-old called the mixed doubles final featuring Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka before leaving the BBC\u2019s Centre Court booth for the last time. Davies worked at ITV before joining the BBC in 1969 and his voice became one of the most distinctive in sport. Davies covered a host of World Cups and Olympic Games while also being a lead commentator for many years at Wimbledon. He was joined by Australian Liz Smylie on his final job and, after the mixed doubles reached its conclusion and the trophy presentations had taken place, he offered his farewell. \u201cWe will miss you Barry,\u201d said Smylie, a former Wimbledon doubles champion. \u201cI will miss you too,\u201d said Davies. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger.

During a search for the vehicles, the officer pulled into a parking lot for an apartment building in the 4000 block of 115th Street in Chicago and found two people inside the Cadillac. The officer used his marked squad car, with its light activated, to block the Cadillac into the parking lot, prosecutors said. He and his partner then got out of the squad car and told Campbell and his passenger to raise their hands. Campbell then put the Cadillac into reverse, backed up slightly, and then accelerated forward toward the officer, prosecutors said. The officer stepped back and fired a shot at Campbell in an attempt to stop the Cadillac. Campbell \u201cbegan making multiple movements within the vehicle\u201d and the officer fired a second shot, which incapacitated him, according to court records. Campbell was shot twice in the shoulder and was given medical attention by the Alsip officers before paramedics arrived, authorities.

The pursuit continued for a few seconds until the officer fired a second shot that incapacitated Campbell, resulting in multiple gunshot wounds to his shoulder. The officer managed to subdue Campbell by stopping his vehicle.\n\nCampbell initially was charged with attempting to run over the officer with a Cadillac but has since been charged with attempted first-degree murder of a police officer due to the severity of the injuries sustained during the confrontation.

NEWTOWN -- Greenridge residents, raise your glasses. Newtown has agreed to share its water with you. The Legislative Council on Wednesday evening authorized First Selectman Pat Llodra to sign a contract allowing a 12-inch water line to run from Newtown along Route 25 to Greenridge, a district of 229 homes in Brookfield. Last week, Brookfield authorized Bill Davidson, its first selectman, to sign the contract. Greenridge's water is contaminated with radiation particles called radionuclides, which are possible carcinogens, said James Rice, the attorney representing Newtown in the matter. Radionuclides includes uranium, radon, and radium, said Marty Handshy, a water consultant for Brookfield's Board of Selectmen. The contract says United Water Co. will not serve Brookfield customers outside of the Greenridge area for three years. The water main will also serve residents of the borough section of Newtown, Rice said. About three years ago, the state approved United Water Co. extending a water line to the Greenridge area, Davidson said last week. The water company planned to do so by diverting water from the Pootatuck aquifer, Newtown's sole water source, Llodra said. She added that her reaction was \"How dare they think they can come to Newtown and take our water?\" Newtown was not invited to participate in the initial discussions between the state and United Water Co., Llodra said. Eventually she and other town officials and lawyers representing the town halted the process until an agreement could be reached, she said. United Water began construction of the water line May 25, 2010, according to the contract, and on June 1, 2010, the Department of Public Utility Control Commissioner ordered that construction cease. The town of Newtown, the borough section of Newtown and the town of Brookfield intervened to protect the interests of their respective citizens, and, in Newtown's case, the Pootatuck Aquifer, the contract says. The town of Newtown has been negotiating with United Water Co. and Brookfield for about seven months now to add stipulations to construction of the line, Llodra said. Rice said if the towns had not reached an agreement, United Water would have flowed the water line without any restrictions, and Newtown would have had to appeal in state Superior Court. Some of Llodra's concerns were that there was no diversion process executed and it was not clear what effect the water line would have on Newtown wells and the Pootatuck Aquifer, she said. The agreement allows United Water to construct the water line project named Newtown Greenridge Interconnection Improvements. However, for three years the line may not serve Brookfield customers living outside the Greenridge area unless there is an emergency, according to the contract. To expand its service area after that time, the company must conduct a study of the Pootatuck Aquifer and Pootatuck River and/or other potential sources of water to show that it Newtown water sources would not be harmed. The study will assist water utility planning in compliance with current and future regulations of the state, and will be used in discussions with Newtown and Brookfield, the contract says. The study could take up to 18 months and United Water will decide when it starts, the contract says. Handshy said the state Department of Public Utility Control in New Britain will rule on the agreement in the near future.

A brawl erupted outside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, with various groups clashing and causing damage to property.\n\nThe article highlights how the combatants seem to be unaware of the Queensbury Rules, which govern boxing matches, and are instead adhering to a public school-style ethos of violence and aggression. The author also mentions that the building in which the conflict is taking place is inaccessible due to disagreements about where the fire exit should be located, which further fuels the tensions.\n\nHowever, beneath the surface-level chaos, the author suggests that there are deeper issues at play, including the long-standing rivalry between the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Greek Orthodox churches. This rivalry is rooted in historical and cultural differences, and it is likely that this tension may be driving the current level of animosity.\n\nThe author also raises an interesting point about the value of the code of Rugby Union, particularly in organizing the monks in the small monastery on the roof between the Copts and the Ethiopian Orthodox churches. This could potentially be an area of common ground between the groups, and a way to bring their differences together.\n\nOverall, the article raises complex questions about the nature of conflict and the role of institutions, and suggests that there are deeper historical and cultural factors at play.

The songs are sorted into the following six categories: love songs, nature and seasons, freedom and peace, folk and traditional songs, songs of faith and children\u2019s songs.

It started as an idea to promote a common European culture and was conceived by a Danish NGO. \u201cIf we Europeans want to step back from just the economy \u2013 coal, metals, and fish \u2013 and to direct ourselves towards culture, we have to take the leadership of Europe into our own hands,\u201d said Jeppe Marsling, the founder and president of the EU song book project. The first edition of the European song book will be released on Europe Day on May 9, 2019. It will contain 162 songs in the local languages of the participating countries and in English. Any profit will be used to finance a second issue that will translate all the songs into the 24 EU languages, so that everyone, whether or not they know English, can sing and comprehend all the lyrics. The songs are sorted into the following six categories: love songs, nature and seasons, freedom and peace, folk and traditional songs, songs of faith and children\u2019s songs. Since May 2015, more than 26,000 people from 15-member states have voted on the six songs, one for each category, which will represent them. Greece just finished voting, and Cyprus is the next on the list to cast its votes. After that, the project will be extended to Portugal, Belgium and Malta, where students, teachers and members of choirs have chosen six songs for each category of their musical tradition prior to opening up the choice to the public. To prepare the Cyprus vote, students and staff of the music academy ARTE have shortlisted 46 Cypriot songs. http://www.eu-songbook.org.Voting is conducted in 24 languages \u2013 including Greek.", "generated_text": "The text describes a EU-wide song book project that aims to promote a common European culture by featuring traditional songs from six participating countries represented by their Cypriot voters.

The project was originally initiated as a suggestion by a Danish NGO in 2016 to promote European culture beyond economic interests, but was halted due to translation issues.\n\n2. The project is now back on track and invites Cypriot citizens to choose their favorite traditional songs for the book.\n\n3. The voting process will last for a month from this Friday, starting the weekend of October 1, 2024.\n\n4. The contest has chosen six categories for Cypriot voters: Love Songs, Nature and Seasons, Freedom and Peace, Folk and Traditional Songs, Songs of Faith and Children's Songs.\n\n5. After Cypriot voters cast their votes, the following countries will be considered for inclusion: Portugal, Belgium, and Malta, in that order.\n\n6.

A raid in Brussels' Forrest neighborhood last Tuesday killed an Algerian with suspected ISIS ties, but Abdeslam was believed to have escaped back to his childhood haunt of Molenbeek, a largely Muslim immigrant neighborhood just outside central Brussels. Using a combination of electronic tracking of mobile phones and what investigators say was human intelligence, according to local media reports and terror analysts, security forces cornered, wounded, and arrested Abdesalm last Friday.

This vulnerability allowed attackers to remotely inject malicious scripts onto YouTube's website, potentially allowing them to manipulate content such as videos, comments, and user interactions.\n\nAccording to Chris Boyd, the malware researcher at Sunbelt Software, the vulnerabilities found in YouTube video pages could be exploited to perform actions such as:\n\n- Blocking fresh comments on specific videos\n- Injecting text into scrolling text sections\n- Accessing sensitive user information\n\nThe implications of this attack are serious, and it's essential for YouTube and other companies to take prompt action to address the vulnerability. It highlights the importance of regular security audits and testing to prevent sophisticated attacks like this one from happening.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Chinese Whisper-like misinformation clouding the actual attack was also commented on by Boyd as an interesting aspect of the attack. However, the simple fact that a well-designed exploit like the XSS vulnerability that affected YouTube could be used by malicious actors in the future remains a cause for concern.

We had a chance to talk Gunsmith with Michael, as well as hear about what&apos;s in his personal gun collection. How many options are there for weapons customization in GRFS? There are 52 guns in the game, each with up to 10 points of customization. There are 20 million plus possible combinations that the user can choose from. What are some of the real weapons that have inspired you in developing GRFS? All the weapons in the game are either based on real firearms or inspired by real firearms. In the event we get our hands on the actual gun, we use that information about recoil impulses, muzzle climb, maneuverability, etc., and try to incorporate that into the weapon design in the game. What are some of the highlights of your personal collection? My personal favorite right now is a bolt action rifle that I just rebuilt from the ground up. It&apos;s nothing special, but knowing that I took the rifle from a pile of parts to a completed gun capable of shooting accurately 800 yards out is pretty gratifying. What&apos;s your favorite Ghost Recon Future Soldier feature? Call me biased, but I would have to say Gunsmith is my favorite feature. I love having the ability to customize my weapons according to my personal preferences and play style. My favorite map has to be Alpha, which is inspired by the location of the Ghost Recon Alpha short film.

This move was seen as a way to provide liquidity to the Indian capital markets and mitigate the impact of rising valuations in a hot stock market.\n\nUnder the current licence agreement with NSE, the successor products to the SGX Nifty family of products are expected to list on the SGX's exchange on or before August 2018.

The research team used a technique called dental moulding to analyze the age of wild brown mouse lemurs in Madagascar's Ranomafana National Park, revealing that on average, they can be around 8 years old. However, the study also highlights the potential role of environmental factors, such as hibernation, in contributing to the observed longevity. Specifically, the researchers found no difference in testosterone levels between males and females, which may indicate that the longevity of female mice lemurs could be more closely tied to hibernation rather than hormonal fluctuations. These findings contribute to ongoing research into the aging process and how it may vary across different species and environments. The study's results have significant implications for understanding the longevity of other primates, including humans. \n\nIn essence, the research suggests that mouse lemurs have a remarkable capacity for aging, and more studies like this one may help us better understand how their bodies adapt to their unique environment and how this relates to human aging. The fact that wild mammals are not immune to environmental factors that may affect aging in humans serves as a reminder of the need to consider diverse factors when studying aging and related phenomena.

While the result of the learning process is not to be dismissed, it is quite simply the joy of the learning journey that motivates Learners -- the process of learning is not the means to an end, but the end itself. It isn\u2019t necessarily the usefulness of the information that excites those with Learner talents; that is more of a hallmark of Input. It\u2019s taking a class, signing up for a webinar series, reading a series of articles that delve deeply into a topic, getting an advanced degree -- these are activities that light up Learners. People high in Learner are inquisitive, but this is not typically expressed in asking a lot of random questions about any or all topics. Rather, satisfying the inquisitive itch for a Learner typically takes the form of deep and thorough exploration through individual research online or in the library, taking a class, or spending regular time with a subject matter expert. Learners can take pleasure in random learning opportunities like online classes, seminars, lecture series or workshops.

While the result of the learning process is not to be dismissed, it is quite simply the joy of the learning journey that motivates Learners -- the process of learning is not the means to an end, but the end itself. It isn\u2019t necessarily the usefulness of the information that excites those with Learner talents; that is more of a hallmark of Input. It\u2019s taking a class, signing up for a webinar series, reading a series of articles that delve deeply into a topic, getting an advanced degree -- these are activities that light up Learners. People high in Learner are inquisitive, but this is not typically expressed in asking a lot of random questions about any or all topics. Rather, satisfying the inquisitive itch for a Learner typically takes the form of deep and thorough exploration through individual research online or in the library, taking a class, or spending regular time with a subject matter expert. Learners can take pleasure in random learning opportunities like online classes, seminars, lecture series or workshops.

Massachusetts businesses, looking to cut their health care costs, are teaming up on a new initiative aimed at sharply cutting the number of people who seek care in hospital emergency rooms when they could be treated elsewhere. Employer groups representing thousands of businesses across the state said Wednesday that they plan to reduce avoidable emergency room visits by 20 percent over the next two years, saving $100 million. More than 40 percent of emergency room visits \u2014 or about 1 million a year \u2014 are thought to be avoidable, according to state data. Many of these patients show up at hospitals with minor infections, sore throats, skin rashes, allergies, and back pain. Such visits can add to wait times in emergency rooms and drive up costs. Hospitals are many times more expensive than doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care clinics, and retail clinics. Employers said they will tackle the issue by better educating their workers about the most appropriate places to get health care, and by designing insurance plans that discourage unnecessary trips to the emergency room. They have not yet detailed what these incentives might be, but the incentives could include lower out-of-pocket costs for visiting a primary-care doctor, higher costs for visiting a hospital \u2014 or both. The initiative represents the first time that so many Massachusetts employers have coalesced around a particular driver of health care spending. It has the support of 20 business groups including Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and Retailers Association of Massachusetts. Hospitals, insurers, and the state Health Policy Commission \u2014 which tracks health spending \u2014 also back the effort. Millions of Massachusetts residents get health insurance through work, with their employers paying a significant portion of those costs. Business owners frequently complain that rising health care costs hamper their ability to hire and grow. State officials and academics have long tracked the inappropriate use of emergency rooms. But Massachusetts has not made progress in curbing unnecessary emergency room visits in at least five years, according to the Health Policy Commission \u2014 even though the vast majority of state residents have health insurance, and many have access to new walk-in clinics and telehealth services that provide alternatives to hospital care. \u201cUnfortunately, for many individuals, the emergency department becomes their main source of primary care,\u201d said David Seltz, executive director of the Health Policy Commission. The Massachusetts College of Emergency Physicians supports the business community\u2019s effort, but objects to estimates that peg avoidable emergency room visits at more than 40 percent. The group prefers a much lower estimate \u2014 3.3 percent \u2014 which was calculated using a much narrower definition. Dr. Scott Weiner, president of the emergency physicians group, noted that it\u2019s much easier to call a visit \u201cavoidable\u201d after the fact. A patient who thinks he is suffering a heart attack may actually have severe heartburn, for example, but he wouldn\u2019t know that until he sees a physician, Weiner noted. Backers of the initiative said they will be careful not to make emergency room visits so expensive that they deter people from going to the hospital when they may be seriously ill. Eileen McAnneny, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said employer groups will create a toolkit that explains \u201cin plain English\u201d the different locations where their workers can get medical care, and the different costs of those sites. \u201cI think this is the start of something big,\u201d McAnneny said of the initiative.

This effort marks the first time multiple Massachusetts businesses have come together to tackle health care spending issues. The move is part of a growing trend where businesses are increasingly prioritizing affordability over profit, as rising health care costs hinder their ability to manage the workforce and compete in the market.\n\nThe initiative's success in achieving 20% reductions in avoidable emergency room visits, which account for about 1 million annual visits, could be attributed to targeted efforts by employer groups such as the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, and Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. These efforts include better educating workers about the most appropriate healthcare locations and designing insurance plans that discourage unnecessary hospital visits.\n\nThe initiative's estimated impact of $100 million in savings over two years, though lower than estimates of $120 million from a previous study by the Health Policy Commission, highlights the significance of this effort and underscores the growing recognition among Massachusetts businesses of the necessity of addressing the rising cost of health care. The efforts of the Health Care For All consumer advocacy group has further noted that the initiative marks a crucial shift in the state towards greater accountability and responsibility from businesses in managing health care costs.\n\nThe success of this business-backed initiative underscores the increasing importance of corporate engagement in the healthcare sector as policymakers continue", "detection_result": {"z_score": 5.5425625842204065, "p": 1.490384071711759e-08, "detected_greenlist_number": 198, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.898097813129425, "Recall": 0.8775306940078735, "Accuracy": 0.8884999752044678}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.898097813129425, "Recall": 0.8775306940078735, "Accuracy": 0.8884999752044678}, "total_statistics": [2644.0, 2687.0, 300.0, 369.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2644.0, 2687.0, 300.0, 369.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 99}
