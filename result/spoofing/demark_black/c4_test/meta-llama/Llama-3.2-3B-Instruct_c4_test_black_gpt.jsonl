However, it makes inaccurate or unsupported factual claims: it presents eight years as an average rather than correctly reflecting the study's phrasing that mouse lemurs \"can live at least eight years,\" and it infers a causal relationship between testosterone levels, female longevity, and hibernation that the prompt does not support. It also overstates the certainty and scope of implications for human aging. These additions constitute invented or overstated facts beyond what the prompt reports.", "Score": "4"}}}

The sequence of shallow- then deep-frying is also reversed in places.

It reverses the frying order (stating deep-fry then shallow-fry instead of shallow then deep in parts), assigns temperatures and times that differ from or contradict the prompt, and adds specific dipping-sauce ingredients (e.g., citronella/lemongrass) that were not present in the original text.
