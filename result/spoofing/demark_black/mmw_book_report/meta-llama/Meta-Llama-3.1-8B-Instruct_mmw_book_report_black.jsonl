Set during World War II, the novel follows the protagonist, Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Air Force bombardier stationed on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa, as he navigates the labyrinthine world of military protocol and psychological manipulation.\n\nThrough Yossarian's character, Heller critiques the military-industrial complex and the dehumanizing effects of war. The title \"Catch-22\" refers to a fictional military regulation that creates a paradoxical situation in which a pilot is exempt from flying, but only if he objects to flying. This paradox highlights the absurdity of military bureaucracy and the ways in which institutions can prioritize process over individual needs.\n\nThe novel's use of satire is biting and incisive, as Heller targets the military and societal norms of the time. Characters such as Milo Minderbinder, the cynical and opportunistic entrepreneur, and Colonel Cathcart, the ruthless and bureaucratic military officer, exemplify the absurdity and cruelty that can permeate institutions.\n\nOne of the novel's most striking aspects is its exploration of the psychological effects of war on individuals.

Throughout the novel, Tarrou's introspection and observations provide a philosophical framework to explore the deeper human questions raised by the plague.\n\n**Themes:**\n\nThe Plague is a rich tapestry of themes, including:\n\n1. **The Absurdity of Humanity:** The novel explores the human propensity for cruelty, selfishness, and inhumanity amidst the suffering and death that surround the plague's devastating impact.\n2.", "detection_result": {"z_score": 3.6950417228136043, "p": 0.00010992534131915033, "detected_greenlist_number": 182, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8752940893173218, "Recall": 0.8668442368507385, "Accuracy": 0.8715000152587891}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.8752940893173218, "Recall": 0.8668442368507385, "Accuracy": 0.8715000152587891}, "total_statistics": [2604.0, 2625.0, 371.0, 400.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2604.0, 2625.0, 371.0, 400.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 62}

The book is a thought-provoking and deeply philosophical work that offers a unique perspective on the human experience.\n\n**Background and Context**\n\nIn Greek mythology, Sisyphus was a king who was condemned by the gods to eternally push a massive boulder up a steep hill, only to have it roll back down, requiring him to start again. Camus uses Sisyphus as a metaphor for the human search for meaning and the futility of striving after an unattainable goal. In the book, Camus examines the concept of absurdist existence, arguing that humanity is confronted with the impossibility of finding ultimate truth or happiness.\n\n**Main Theme: The Absurd**\n\nThe book's central theme is the absurd, which is described as an inherent contradiction between humanity's desire for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the world. Camus argues that humans seek to impose meaning on a seemingly meaningless world, but this effort is ultimately doomed to fail. The absurd is not seen as a negative aspect of human existence but rather as a fundamental characteristic that shapes human behavior and experience.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\nSome of the key concepts introduced in the book include:\n\n* **Absurdism**: Camus", "detection_result": {"z_score": 2.7712812921102032, "p": 0.0027918084031893775, "detected_greenlist_number": 174, "total_generated_tokens_number": 300}, "final_all_token_results": {"Precision": 0.871899425983429, "Recall": 0.8628110289573669, "Accuracy": 0.8691666722297668}, "final_possible_token_results": {"Precision": 0.871899425983429, "Recall": 0.8628110289573669, "Accuracy": 0.8691666722297668}, "total_statistics": [2566.0, 2649.0, 377.0, 408.0], "possible_token_statistics": [2566.0, 2649.0, 377.0, 408.0], "generation_args": {"delta_actual": 2.0, "delta_predicted": 2.0, "ctx_width": 3, "max_new_token": 300, "total_word_num": 20, "sample_strategy": "top_k", "blackbox": 1}, "prompt_idx": 63}
