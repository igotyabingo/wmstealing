The novel revolves around the experiences of Captain John Yossarian, a US Army Air Forces bombardier stationed in Sicily during World War II, and his struggle against the ineffable bureaucracy that he encounters both on and off the battlefield.\n\n**Plot Summary:**\nThe story opens with Yossarian, a non-commissioned officer in a bomber squadron, trying to escape from the inane routines and dehumanizing pressures of military life, particularly the ceaseless threat of missions, the fear of death, and the arbitrary and often cruel regulations imposed by superiors. The central conflict stems from a paradoxical regulation: Catch-22, a rule that states a pilot can be grounded from duty if he is deemed mentally unfit to fly, but the desire not to fly is itself the primary evidence of his sanity.
